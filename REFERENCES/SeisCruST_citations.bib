@article{Afsari2011,
	abstract = {Receiver functions are widely employed to detect P-to-S converted waves and are especially useful to image seismic discontinuities in the crust. In this study we used the P receiver function technique to investigate the velocity structure of the crust beneath the Northwest Zagros and Central Iran and map out the lateral variation of the Moho boundary within this area. Our dataset includes teleseismic data (Mb ≥5.5, epicentral distance from 30$\,^{\circ}$to 95$\,^{\circ}$) recorded at 12 three-component short-period stations of Kermanshah, Isfahan and Yazd telemetry seismic networks. Our results obtained from P receiver functions indicate clear Ps conversions at the Moho boundary. The Moho depths were firstly estimated from the delay time of the Moho converted phase relative to the direct P wave beneath each network. Then, we used the P receiver function inversion to find the properties of the Moho discontinuity such as depth and velocity contrast. Our results obtained from PRF are in good agreement with those obtained from the P receiver function modeling. We found an average Moho depth of about 42 km beneath the Northwest Zagros increasing toward the Sanandaj-Sirjan Metamorphic Zone and reaches 51 km, where two crusts (Zagros and Central Iran) are assumed to be superposed. The Moho depth decreases toward the Urmieh-Dokhtar Cenozoic volcanic belt and reaches 43 km beneath this area. We found a relatively flat Moho beneath the Central Iran where, the average crustal thickness is about 42 km. Our P receiver function modeling revealed a shear wave velocity of 3.6 km/s in the crust of Northwest Zagros and Central Iran increasing to 4.5 km/s beneath the Moho boundary. The average shear wave velocity in the crust of UDMA as SSZ is 3.6 km/s, which reaches to 4.0 km/s while in SSZ increases to 4.3 km/s beneath the Moho.},

abstract = {The crustal structure of the Rec{\^{o}}ncavo-Tucano basin, an aborted rift system that developed in NE Brazil during extension related to the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean, has been investigated through local constraints from receiver functions developed at 18 seismic stations in the region. Gravity modelling has proved unable to unequivocally localize crustal thinning under the basin depocentre and, together with a general lack of sediments from a putative thermal sag phase, this has led to a range of basin formation models invoking either pure or simple shear or a combination of both. In particular, the 'flexural cantilever' model has assumed simple shear extension in the upper crust and pure shear extension in the lower crust and mantle, enabling local erosion of the rift flanks after footwall uplift and regional erosion of the thermal sag phase after magmatic underplate of the basin's crust. Our results reveal that the crust is over 40 km thick beneath the Tucano and Rec{\^{o}}ncavo basins and that it contains a thick (5-8 km) layer of high velocity (Vs > 4.0 km s-1) material below ∼35 km depth. These observations contrast with structure immediately West (S{\~{a}}o Francisco Craton) and East (Borborema Province) of the basin, for which crustal thicknesses average 42 and 36 km, respectively, lower crustal velocities are below 4.0 km s-1, and local instances of crust as thin as 33.5 km are observed. We propose, in agreement with the 'flexural cantilever' model, that the fast velocity layer making the basin's lowermost crust resulted from mafic underplating after stretching and thinning during the syn-rift phase, restoring crustal thickness to pre-rift values (or larger) and providing the necessary buoyancy to trigger regional uplift. Moreover, although not pervasive, instances of thin crust along the footwall could be related to rift flank erosion. We thus conclude that, regardless of the mode of extension in the upper crust, our results favour models of basin formation invoking extension of the lower crust by pure shear.},

abstract = {Seismic investigations in the Sudanese and Yemeni sections of the Red Sea showed contrasting structural styles across the two surveyed areas of the opposing flanks. Off Sudan, seaward of an about 50 km broad zone of stretched continental crust, different domains of oceanic crust were identified. The oldest of these domains was found under an up to 6 km thick cover of sediments which include a 1 to 2 km thick pre-evaporite sequence. These sediments are interpreted to be part of a pull apart basin generated during the initial stages of Red Sea evolution. Towards the Red Sea axial trough, a structural boundary separates this from younger oceanic crust which is covered only by post-evaporite sediments. This sequence thins progressively from about 800 m at the boundary to zero at the axial trough. Off Yemen, in contrast, oceanic crust is confined to the axial trough zone, which terminates southward of 16°N. Further south to 14°N, no oceanic crust has yet been formed.

abstract = {In July 1985, deep seismic measurements were carried out in close European-Tunisian cooperation along the extension of the main European Geotraverse (EGT) seismic refraction line through Tunisia up to the Saharian platform. The execution and results of this experiment are described and presented in this paper. Eight shots from seven different shotpoints were recorded by 120 mobile stations deployed in a network of nine reversed profile segments, with a total surveyed length exceeding 1300 km. The 6-km/s isoline is found everywhere at great depth, usually between 10 and 15 km. The main feature of the crust, sediments excluded, is its low average velocity (6 km/s), with no clear evidence for any high-velocity lower crust, except maybe in the Kairouan area. For the most part of continental Tunisia, the Moho depth varies between 30 and 35 km, with a maximum depth of 37 km in the Kasserine area. To the north and northeast, the continental crust merges into the thinned crust of the Sardinian Channel and Pelagian Sea. This crust has a typically higher mean velocity and a minimum thickness of only 13 km in the central Sardinian Channel, where the Moho depth is 21 km. In the upper mantle, we derive consistent velocity values in the 7.9-8.1-km/s range. Offsets observed in Pn-wave travel time curves may indicate steps in the Moho beneath the Tellian chains. Finally, observations of two sea shots at large distance (250-500 km) reveal the presence of an upper-mantle reflector under central Tunisia, at a depth of 87 km, with an unusually high apparent velocity of 9.4 km/s below. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {We investigate the structure of the crust beneath the main island of Tierra del Fuego through a teleseismic receiver function analysis and ambient seismic noise autocorrelation using data of four available broad-band stations. The area is situated in a remote region of southern Argentina where the interaction between the South American and Scotia plates define the Magallanes-Fagnano Fault System. Crustal thickness, Vp/Vs ratios and S-wave velocity models were estimated using the H-k stacking method and the inversion of receiver functions with the Neighbourhood Algorithm. Furthermore, we applied an ambient seismic noise autocorrelation procedure to identify PmP Moho reflections at all stations. The three methods provide consistent estimates for the crustal thickness which ranges from about 24.5 km in the northern part of the Island to about 39.2 km in the south. The lowest and highest values of S-wave velocity found, in the most superficial layers of the crust, correlate with the presence of Tertiary and upper Cretacic sediments in the north and with older geological units composed by more consolidated lithologies in the south, respectively. Despite the diverse geological and tectonic settings present, our results do not change significantly for different parameters or subsidiary data sets, i.e., showing the robustness of our models which likely represent closely the local structure beneath the Island. This area is considered a very seismically active one and its crustal structure has been little explored demonstrating the importance of having new models and the necessity to increase the station coverage to allow a more detailed study of the region. Furthermore, the models presented here provide better constraints on the crustal structure, and will facilitate studies of the regional seismicity that can improve our understanding of the seismic hazard posed by earthquakes such as the magnitude 7.5 and 7.8 events that occurred in 1949.},

abstract = {Stacking over 2300 P-to-S receiver functions recorded by 33 SAFARI (Seismic Arrays for African Rift Initiation) broadband seismic stations that we installed in the vicinity of the Malawi and Luangwa rift zones (MRZ and LRZ, respectively) reveals significant variations of crustal thickness (32.8–46.3 km) and Vp/Vs (1.69–1.85). The resulting crustal stretching factor is about 1.05–1.08 for the MRZ, which is approximately 10–40% lower than that observed in the mature segments of the East African Rift System (EARS). The low stretching factor is consistent with the general absence of volcanism in the MRZ, and the relatively high Vp/Vs (≥ 1.81) beneath the southern MRZ, when combined with observations from previous studies, indicate the possible existence of crustal partial melting, elevated temperatures or fluid-filled deep crustal faults that are likely associated with lithospheric stretching. In sharp contrast with the southern MRZ, low Vp/Vs measurements in the range of 1.69–1.72 are observed along the western boundary of the northern MRZ, which could be attributable to the infiltration of magma-derived CO2 into the crust. The LRZ shows negligible crustal thinning and a Vp/Vs that is comparable to the globally averaged value for continental crust, suggesting a complete post-rifting recovery of crustal properties in terms of crustal thickness and Vp/Vs.},

abstract = {Wide angle reflection and refraction seismic (WARRS) surveys at key sections of the Northern Red Sea and adjacent areas enabled a better definition of the crust and upper mantle structure. A fundamental asymmetry of the region was revealed by the results of profiles, which cover both flanks of the Red Sea main trough, the coastal plains and the bordering Precambrian shields. This asymmetry is clearly expressed by the presence of different crustal types on both flanks: the western flank shows oceanised crust within only 20 km off the African coast, while the whole eastern flank is underlain by a continental type of crust. Likewise, the shape of the continent-ocean transitions differs significantly on both flanks: the Arabian margin extends almost into the centre of the Red Sea and shows considerable stretching and attenuation of the continental crust, while the African margin, on the other hand, even thickens towards the escarpment and appears very abrupt. The influence of the Red Sea opening, as reflected by the decrease of seismic velocities and the increase of Poisson's ratio in the upper mantle due to partial melting, is strictly limited to the area seaward of the Egyptian escarpment. The asymmetry in the Northern Red Sea is regarded to be the expression of strike-slip processes in the initial stages of Red Sea evolution. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

abstract = {The Atlantic margin off Morocco with its neighbouring Jurassic oceanic crust is one of the oldest on earth. It is conjugate to the Nova Scotia margin of North America. The SISMAR marine seismic survey acquired deep reflection seismic data as well as wide-angle seismic profiles in order to image the deep structure of the margin, characterize the nature of the crust in the transitional domain and define the geometry of the synrift basins. We present results from the combined interpretation of the reflection seismic, wide-angle seismic and gravity data along a 440-km-long profile perpendicular to the margin at 33-34°N, extending from nearly normal oceanic crust in the vicinity of Coral Patch seamount to the coast at El Jadida and approximately 130 km inland. The shallow structure is well imaged by the reflection seismic data and shows a thick sedimentary cover that is locally perturbed by salt tectonics and reverse faulting. The sedimentary basin thickens from 1.5 km on the normal oceanic crust to a maximum thickness of 6 km at the base of the continental slope. Multichannel seismic (MCS) data image basement structures including a few tilted fault blocks and a transition zone to a thin crust. A strong discontinuous reflection at 12 s two-way travel-time (TWT) is interpreted as the Moho discontinuity. As a result of the good data quality, the deep crustal structure (depth and velocity field) is well constrained through the wide-angle seismic modelling. The crust thins from 35 km underneath the continent to approximately 7 km at the western end of the profile. The transitional region has a width of 150 km. Crustal velocities are lowest at the continental slope, probably as a result of faulting and fracturing of the upper crust. Upper-mantle velocities could be well defined from the ocean bottom seismometer (OBS) and land station data throughout the model. {\textcopyright} 2004 RAS.},

abstract = {Since June 1992, a seismic network of five digital stations has been operating in southwestern Tanzania, with the aim of investigating the seismic activity and its partitioning with regard to depth in the area between Lake Rukwa and Lake Malawi. During the period 1992 June 15 to 1994 December 31, a reliable location was obtained for 199 local earthquakes: 13 were recorded by all five seismic stations, 71 by four stations and 115 by three seismic stations, with both P- and S-wave arrival-time measurements. Many earthquakes are located in the south-eastern part of the Rukwa basin, along its eastern border in a 20 km narrow zone centred on the Lupa fault, but the more active area is the Songwe valley, characterized by a narrowing of the basin in the proximity of the important uplift of the Mbeya range. Seismic activity is also present inside intrabasinal faulted blocks. The earthquake depth distribution presents an upper seismicity cut-off at a depth of 10 to 12 km. This upper stability zone is followed by the peak of seismic activity in the depth range 12 to 14 km, where 20 per cent of the earthquakes occurred. At greater depths, the level of activity continuously decreases up to a depth of 34 km. A crustal thickness of 42-5+4 km is estimated using arrivals identified as the PmP waves reflected at the base of the crust, indicating that the deeper earthquakes are really occurring in the lower crust and not in the upper mantle. This analysis confirms at a local scale what is suggested by geophysical and geological observations at a global scale: in the western branch of the East African Rift System, border faults penetrate to lower crustal levels in a lithosphere that is cold and mechanically strong.},

abstract = {We analyzed tens of thousands of receiver-function data recorded by 185 broadband seismic stations to study the crustal structure beneath the northeast China. Moho depth and average crustal V p/. V s ratio were measured at each station using the H- $\kappa$ grid searching technique. For stations located above unconsolidated sediments, we applied the H- $\beta$ method to remove strong shallow reverberations and generate subsurface receiver functions that allow for effective H- $\kappa$ analysis. The measurements show that the Songliao basin has a relatively thin crust ($\sim$31 km), and the Moho depth increases significantly from southeast ($\sim$27 km) to northwest ($\sim$35 km). The northwestward tilting of the Songliao basin may suggest that it was initiated by lithospheric flexure due to the load of the Great Xing'an range in the Jurassic before the large-scale extension in the Cretaceous. Moho depth varies from 26.7 km to 42.3 km across the study area, with the shallowest and deepest Moho being located at the eastern flank of the Songliao basin and the Great Xing'an range, respectively. The Moho depth correlates well with the surface topography in the western part, but not the central and eastern parts of the study area. The residual topography computed based on the Airy's isostasy model indicates that the high topography at the eastern flank of the Songliao basin, the Changbaishan volcanic center, and the southern end of the Great Xing'an range is likely dynamically supported by the upper mantle. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Here we report estimates of crustal thickness and Poisson's ratios for northern Vietnam, based on teleseismic receiver function analysis of observations from a dense broadband seismic array. The seismic array comprised of 24 stations distributed evenly over northern Vietnam, from whose records we examined 190 teleseismic events of Mw>5.5 for the period 2006-2008. Using the radial receiver functions calculated from teleseismic records at individual stations, the optimum crustal thickness and Vp/Vs (where Vp and Vs are the velocities of P- and S-waves, respectively) ratio beneath each station were determined using the H-$\kappa$ (where H is crustal thickness and $\kappa$ is defined as the Vp/Vs ratio) stacking algorithm. Determined values of crustal thickness range from 26.5km to 36.4km, with an average of 31.0±2.1km. The simple pattern of variation of crustal thickness in the northeastern region of the study area, with a mean of $\sim$31km, suggests that the sector belongs to the craton of the South China block. A highly variable crustal thickness is found over the northwestern region of northern Vietnam, ranging from $\sim$29.5km to $\sim$36.4km, implying that complex tectonic processes have taken place in this region. The thinnest crust is found in the Red River Delta, where it ranges from 26.5km to 30.4km, which is suggestive of a recent rifting process. The determinations of crustal thickness show a good linear correlation with Bouguer gravity anomalies. Lower values of Poisson's ratio in the northeastern and Red River Delta sectors suggest a more felsic crust, and larger values in the northwestern sector suggest lithospheric extension in the Song Da depression. The findings enhance our understanding of the geotectonic architecture of the northern Vietnam region. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We use data from the CAT/SCAN seismic deployment in southern Italy to reconstruct the crust and uppermost mantle structure above one of the narrowest active subduction zones worldwide, the Calabrian Arc, where the last fragment of the former Tethys ocean is being subducted. An E-W time-domain profi le composed of teleseismic receiver functions shows the geometry of the main seismic discontinuities beneath Calabria. It provides a clear two-dimensional (2-D) image of the subducting Ionian plate at shallow depth where it bends and starts to descend into the mantle. In the profi le the Moho of the subducting Ionian plate lies at $\sim$35 km and gently dips westward beneath the eastern part of Calabria. Then the depth increases steeply to $\sim$80 km below western Calabria. The locus where the Ionian plate changes its dip and starts to subduct corresponds to the transition from an uplifted plateau to an extensional basin at the surface. It suggests that the Ionian plate has not rolled back relative to Calabria since it slowed. This implies the uplift of the Sila Plateau is more likely due to underplating than eastward growth of the mantle wedge. When projected on a map, the depths of the Ionian Moho beneath each seismic station reveal a more complex geometry for the subducting plate, including an unexpected deepening northward. This may be related to a tear in the plate or other tectonic motions between Calabria and the Southern Apennines. Thus the relationship between the imaged geometry of the subducting plate and structural elements at the surface provides new knowledge about the geodynamic evolution of the subduction system and the tectonics of the Calabrian Arc. {\textcopyright} 2009 Geological Society of America.},

abstract = {Crustal configuration of the central Chugoku region with disposition of the Philippine Sea Plate (PHS) in this area are investigated through the receiver function approach using short-period Hi-net data. Images of the upper mantle discontinuities are also obtained. Restituted short-period receiver functions bring out discernible variations in average composition of the crust and its thickness in the study region. The Vp/ Vs values in the study area are generally high, reaching values in excess of 1.85 at a few places. The central part of the study region showing the highest Vp/Vs values is coincidentally a subregion of least seismicity, possibly bestowed with special subsurface structure. Migrated receiver function images, both Ps and Pps images, unambiguously trace the NW subducting PHS taking a steeper plunge in the northwest part of the Chugoku region reaching depths of 70 km from its low dip disposition in the southeast. An excellent correlation of the subducting PHS with the hypocenters is also seen. We demonstrate that short-period data after restitution and application of appropriate low pass filters can indeed detect presence of the global 410-km and 660-km discontinuities and map their disposition reasonably well. Our migrated receiver functions image the deflections in the 410-km and 660-km discontinuities in an anti-correlated fashion on expected lines of Clapeyron slope predictions induced by subduction of the Pacific plate (PAC) beneath Japanese islands, though PAC itself is feebly traced but shows good correlation with slab seismicity.

abstract = {Data from 90 permanent broad-band stations spread over central and eastern Europe were analysed using Ps receiver functions to study the crustal and upper-mantle structure down to the mantle transition zone. Receiver functions provide valuable information on structural features, which are important for the resolution of European lithospheric dynamics. Moho depths vary from less than 25 km in extensional areas in central Europe to more than 50 km at stations in eastern Europe (Craton) and beneath the Alpine-Carpathian belt. A very shallow Moho depth can be observed at stations in the Upper Rhine Graben area (ca. 25 km), whereas, for example, stations in the SW Bohemian Massif show a significantly deeper Moho interface at a depth of 38 km. Vp/ Vs ratios vary between 1.60 and 1.96, and show no clear correlation to the major tectonic units, thus probably representing local variations in crustal composition. Delayed arrivals of converted phases from the mantle transition zone are observed at many stations in central Europe, whereas stations in the cratonic area show earlier arrivals compared with those calculated from the IASP91 Earth reference model. Differential delay times between the P410s and P660s phases indicate a thickened mantle transition zone beneath the eastern Alps, the Carpathians and the northern Balkan peninsula, whereas the transition zone thickness in eastern and central Europe agrees with the IASP91 value. The thickening of the mantle transition zone beneath the eastern Alps and the Carpathians could be caused by cold, deeply subducted oceanic slabs. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2008 RAS.},

Our primary results reveal that the local crustal thickness varies from 38 to 46 km with an average value of 43 km. Thicker crust is found beneath the western Hentey Mountains, while thinner crust is located in the southern area of the Zuunbayan fault zone. The Bouguer gravity anomalies exhibit a strong correlation with the overall crustal thickness pattern throughout most of our study regime. Moreover, a new approach which integrates the Bouguer anomaly gradient and the receiver function-derived crustal thickness is adopted to calculate the density of the lower crust underneath central Mongolia. Fairly dense lower crust of approximately 3000 kg/m3 is found in the Middle Gobi Desert. The measured crustal Vp/Vs ratio ranges from 1.68 to 1.83 with an average value of 1.74. Low Vp/Vs ratio is found beneath the western Hentey Mountains. In general, low Vp/Vs ratios correlate well with regions of quartz-rich crust and high heat flow. High Vp/Vs ratios occur in the Middle Gobi volcanic regions and the Mesozoic Southern Gobi Basin.},

abstract = {Thirty-three seismic stations throughout Thailand were used to infer the crustal thickness, Vp/Vs ratio and Poisson's ratio of Thailand using the receiver function technique. The crustal thickness increases from around 31. km in the Shan-Thai terrane (STT) in the west to around 38. km in the Khorat Plateau (KP-ICT) located in the Indochina terrane (ICT) in the east. Similarly, the mean Vp/Vs and Poisson's ratios derived here show that Vp/Vs increases from 1.69 to 1.73 from the STT to the KP-ICT, while Poisson's ratio increases from 0.23 to 0.25 from the STT to the KP-ICT. Our results are well supported by geological evidence found at the surface. In addition, we incorporate gravity and magnetic data to constrain the crustal properties of Thailand. The low Poisson's ratios show that the crust of Thailand is mostly felsic. Only the lower crust of KP-ICT is different as it is thicker, denser and has higher mafic composition than the other terranes of Thailand. This special feature in the KP-ICT is required to explain the lower Bouguer anomaly in the KP-ICT. In addition, we interpret the crustal evolution and deformation of these terranes and compare our results with the results from the Vietnam network of the ICT.},

Using the teleseismic waveform data from 141 permanent stations and 785 temporary stations in southwest China, we obtain the crustal thickness and average Poisson's ratio by the H-$\kappa$ stacking of receiver functions. In the west (the SE Tibetan Plateau and the Yunnan-Burma-Thailand block) and southeast (the Cathaysian block and southern Yangtze craton) of the study region, there are high correlation coefficients for the crustal thicknesses between what we obtain from the receiver functions and what we calculate from the Airy isostasy model, indicating that a state of isostasy can be achieved at the crust-mantle boundary beneath these two regions. In the northeast (northern Yangtze craton), the correlation coefficient is lower, indicating that the effect of the lithosphere needs to be considered for a regional isostasy. Intermediate Poisson's ratios (0.26 ≤ $\sigma$ ≤ 0.28) are found beneath the northern Panzhihua-Emeishan region. Combing the high-velocity features from previous study, we speculate that it may be related to the Emeishan large igneous province. High Poisson's ratios ($\sigma$ > 0.28) are found beneath the SE Tibetan Plateau and the nearby strike-slip faults, such as the Anninghe-Zemuhe fault and the northern Xiaojiang fault. Combing the low-velocity zones from previous study, we speculate that there may be partially melted and lower crustal flow.},

abstract = {The southeastern margin of China is an ideal area to study the modern plate interactions. The previous models, however, are poorly constrained with respect to the geometry due to the sparse coverage. Here we present new observations from a temporary array with 20 stations in southeastern China. We isolated converted seismic phases in the P and S wave coda to generate receiver function from the structure of the crust and upper mantle. By using H-K stacking and common conversion point stacking, the geometry of discontinuities above was imaged along the southeastern Chinese coastline. The CCP section shows Moho dips gently northeastward with a mean depth of 30. km. The 410 and 660. km discontinuities are at the depth close to IASP91 model. This means that we have not seen any significant anomaly from Moho and mantle transition zone that corresponded with the geodynamics of plate subducting, instead, we found that the crust was ruptured by Min River fault to depth of the Moho. We provide a 2D map of Moho topography by combining our crustal thickness to that from permanent stations, active seismic and OBS offshore profiles. The map is consistent with previous studies and shows a crust that thins coastward and southwestward in the rate of $\sim$. 1.5. km per 100. km. We image the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary at a depth of 60 to 70. km by using S-wave to combine with the P-wave. Our crustal structure suggests that Min River fault certainly plays an important role in adjusting regional stress field induced by plate interactions in the study area. Our lithospheric thickness is more consistent with a very strongly attenuated continental lithosphere. Given the close proximity to the coast this might suggest that the lithospheric mantle transitions to oceanic before the crust does. Alternatively, we may infer that the continental lithosphere has been thermally eroded in this region. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The thinnest crust is $\sim$27. km in the south Yangtze craton and the deepest Moho ($\sim$70. km) is estimated in the eastern margin of the Tibetan plateau. The distribution of Poisson's ratio shows the heterogeneity that high Poisson's ratios (. $\upsilon$>. 0.27) are found in the Chuandian plateau, intermediate values (0.24. ≤. $\upsilon$≤. 0.27) exhibit in the Ordos block, the Qilian orogen, the Qinling-Dabie orogen, the Songpan-Ganzi terrane and the Sichuan basin, and low values (. $\upsilon$<. 0.24) appear in the Yangtze craton. The higher Poisson's ratios (. $\upsilon$>. 0.30) in the southeastern margin of the Tibetan plateau can be considered as the evidence of the dominantly mafic composition or locally partial melting in crust.

The crustal thickness (H) and average crustal VP/VS ratio (k) beneath every station were estimated using the H-k stacking method. Crustal thicknesses near the Fujian Province range from 28.3 to 32.8 km with an average of 31.1 km, and the corresponding VP/VS ratios vary from 1.70 to 1.84 with a mean of 1.76. From inland to offshore of the Fujian Province, the crustal thicknesses decrease and Poisson's ratios increase. These may indicate decreasing SiO2 and increasing calc-alkaline contents in the crust. The discontinuity structures such as the Moho, subducting slab, the 410- and 660-km discontinuities (hereafter we call them the 410 and the 660) are also studied using common converted point (CCP) stacking of receiver functions. Along two NW-SE lines of central and northern Taiwan, the CCP stacking results show a western dipping structure at depths above 50 km, suggesting that the Philippine Sea plate is probably subducting beneath the Eurasian continent plate near the central and northern Taiwan. The CCP stacking results show sharp and flat 410- and 660-km discontinuities, and the transition zone thickness (TZT) is the same as that of ambient mantle beneath Fujian and Taiwan Strait, but thickens in the east of Taiwan. These results suggest that (1) the subducting Eurasian continent plate is confined to the depths above 410 km beneath Fujian and Taiwan Strait; and (2) the South China Sea slab may reach the transition zone beneath the east of Taiwan. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Crustal thickness and Poisson's ratio are two important parameters for understanding the crustal structure, composition, and deformation of the South China block. Due to the complicated crustal structure and poor signal-to-noise ratio of teleseismic data at dozens of stations in South China, the receiver-function H–$\kappa$ stacking produces large uncertainty and deviation when estimating these two crustal parameters. In this paper, we improve the technique of the joint inversion of receiver function and gravity data and utilize it to improve the estimates of crustal thickness and Poisson's ratio in South China. We calculate the receiver functions of 245 permanent seismic stations from the teleseismic data recorded during 2013–2015 and then carry out the joint inversion on the receiver functions and the complete Bouguer gravity anomalies data. The joint inversion reduces the uncertainty of each single-method inversion and enhances the accuracy of estimation. Our results demonstrate that the crustal thickness, ranging 26.1–46.5 km, is large in the NW (38–46.5 km) and small in the SE (26–34 km) with a NNE-trending gradient zone along the line of Yichang–Jishou–Baise in central South China. The crustal Poisson's ratio, ranging 0.20–0.31, is high (0.28–0.31) in most of the northern South China, intermediate (0.26–0.29) around the eastern coastal area, very low (0.20–0.24) within the Jiangnan orogenic belt and around the southern coastal area, and slightly low (0.22–0.26) in other places. With the constraints of previous geological and geophysical studies, we suggested that the notable low-value belt of crustal Poisson's ratio (between the lines of Shitai–Jiujiang–Yiyang–Jishou–Baise and Shaoxing–Jiangshan–Pingxiang–Yongzhou–Guigang–Beihai) represents the possible suture zone between Yangtze and Cathaysia sub-blocks in South China during the Neoproterozoic.},

A total number of 981 receiver functions were analyzed, from data recorded by 28 broadband seismic stations from the Peruvian permanent seismic network, the regional temporary SisNort network and one CTBTO station. The Moho depth and average crustal Vp/Vs ratio were determined at each station using the H-k stacking technique to identify the arrival times of primary P to S conversion and crustal reverberations (PpPms, PpSs + PsPms). The results show that the Moho depth correlates well with the surface topography and varies significantly from west to east, showing a shallow depth of around 25 km near the coast, a maximum depth of 55–60 km beneath the Andean Cordillera, and a depth of 35–40 km further to the east in the Amazonian Basin. The bulk crustal Vp/Vs ratio ranges between 1.60 and 1.88 with the mean of 1.75. Higher values between 1.75 and 1.88 are found beneath the Eastern and Western Cordilleras, consistent with a mafic composition in the lower crust. In contrast values vary from 1.60 to 1.75 in the extreme flanks of the Eastern and Western Cordillera indicating a felsic composition. We find a positive relationship between crustal thickness, Vp/Vs ratio, the Bouguer anomaly, and topography. These results are consistent with previous studies in other parts of Peru (central and southern regions) and provide the first crustal thickness estimates for the high cordillera in northern Peru.},

abstract = {Continental China consists of a complex amalgamation of geotectonic units and has experienced strong and widespread tectonic deformation since the Mesozoic. To understand its geological structure better, we conducted a systematic receiver function analysis using a total of 83 509 teleseismic traces in the time period of 2009-2010 recorded by 798 broad-band stations, among which 749 stations are permanent digital seismic stations from China Earthquake Networks Center and 49 stations were temporarily deployed in northern Central Tibet. A standard H-$\kappa$ stacking method is employed to determine Moho depth and Vp/Vs ratio underneath each station from teleseismic receiver function analysis. The obtained Moho depth variations are generally consistent with those determined from various deep seismic soundings profiles. We combine our results with those from previous receiver functions studies to produce a high-resolution map of Moho depth and Vp/Vs variation for continental China. Compared to previous studies, the new study concerns many more stations and the resulting Moho depth map has much higher lateral resolution, especially in the eastern China. Overall, the Moho depth variation has a remarkable correlation with major tectonic units in continental China. For example, across the well-known gravity gradient line in east China, there is a clear shift in Moho depths. In general, the map of Vp/Vs ratio shows relatively high anomalies underneath Tibetan Plateau, along the gravity gradient line, and under several volcanoes.},

abstract = {We estimated crustal structures under 18 broadband stations in southern Korea by combining receiver functions and surface-wave dispersion with the genetic algorithm (GA). Estimated crustal structures were analyzed together with previously determined structures under four stations (GKP, INCN, SNU, and TJN) in Chang et al. (2004). The trend of Moho depths estimated from the GA inversion generally coincides with the surface topography, ranging from 26 km to 36 km in the inland. However, the Moho depth distribution does not agree with the topography in the region around the Chugaryeong fault, which extends approximately north-northeast-south-southwest in the central Korean Peninsula. The shallow Moho depth under this region may be related to consequential crustal thinning processes along the fault caused by extensional tectonic movements. Another discrepancy is found in the Gyeongsang basin formed in a retroarc setting by the subduction of the Izanagi Plate in the early Cretaceous. A thick crust observed in the basin may be caused by two factors - maturity of the basin and underplating of magma materials. Average crustal velocities vary from 6.02 km/sec to 6.51 km/ sec in southern Korea. This variation indicates that crustal structures in southern Korea involve diverse velocity profiles that change rapidly with distance. Remarkably, a clear velocity discontinuity is observed at the depth range of 8-10 km under several stations.},

Moho depth and average crustal Vp/. Vs ratio were measured at each station. The Ordos plateau and the Trans-North China Orogen east of the Ordos are underlain by a moderately thick crust of $\sim$. 42. km. The Weihe Graben lying at the southern edge of the Ordos plateau has a thin crust of $\sim$. 30. km, while its southern neighbor, the Qinling orogenic belt shows a thick crust extending to as much as 45. km deep. The Moho depth beneath the NE margin of the Tibetan plateau varies from 55 to 65. km. We found a remarkable contrast between the Tibetan and Ordos plateaus in the measured Poisson's ratio: the Ordos plateau is featured by a high Poisson's ratio while the Tibetan margin has a very low Poisson's ratio. In general, mafic lower crustal rocks have a higher Poisson's ratio than felsic ones. The measured low Poisson's ratio beneath the NE margin of the Tibetan plateau thus indicates that the crustal column beneath the margin is rather felsic, which seems to be inconsistent with a scenario of an inflated crust due to extrusion of lower crust material from the Tibetan plateau to the margin. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {[1] We collected and processed a large amount of high-quality broadband teleseismic waveform data recorded by the 48 Chinese National Digital Seismic Network stations to estimate large-scale lateral variations of crustal thickness and Vp/Vs ratio (hence Poisson's ratio) beneath China. A statistical method was used to select mutually coherent receiver functions at each station, which yielded over 200 traces for most of the stations. With the conventional H-kappa; (the crustal thickness and Vp/V s ratio) approach, there is a large trade-off between H and K. Consequently, multiple maxima are frequently observed in the H-kappa; domain. We introduced a weight function that measures the coherence between the P-to-S conversion and the reverberation phases at each H-kappa; grid to reduce the trade-off. A 4th-root stacking method was further applied to reduce uncorrelated noise relative to the linear stack. These modifications turned out to be very effective in reducing the H-kappa; trade-off and yielded reliable estimates of crustal thickness and Vp/V s ratio. The crust beneath eastern China is as thin as 31-33 km and the underlying Moho is relatively flat and sharp. In the western part of China, the crust is considerably thicker and shows large variations. The Moho is observed at about 51 km depth along the Tian Shan fold system and about 84 km deep beneath the central part of the Tibetan Plateau. The transition occurs at the so-called N-S belt between about 100° and 110°E, which is featured by unusually high seismicity and large gravity anomalies. The average V p/Vs ratio over the mainland China crust is about 1.730 ($\sigma$ = 0.249), significantly lower than the global average 1.78 ($\sigma$ = 0.27) of the continental crust. This lower Vp/Vs ratio may suggest a general absence of mafic lowermost crustal layer beneath China. Copyright 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {Since 2004 more than 7000 km of full-crustal reflection profiles have been collected across Australia to give a total of more than 11000 km, providing valuable new constraints on crustal structure. A further set of hitherto unexploited results comes from 150 receiver functions distributed across the continent, mostly from portable receiver sites. These new data sets provide a dramatic increase in data coverage compared with previous studies, and reveal the complex structure of the Australian continent in considerable detail. A new comprehensive model for Moho depth across Australia and its immediate environment is developed by utilizing multiple sources of information. On-shore and off-shore refraction experiments are supplemented by receiver functions from a large number of portable stations and the recently augmented set of permanent stations, and Moho picks from the full suite of reflection transects. The composite data set provides a much denser sampler of most of the continent than before, though coverage remains low in the remote areas of the Simpson and Great Sandy deserts. The various data sets provide multiple estimates of the depth to Moho in many regions and the consistency between the different techniques is high. In a number of instances, differences in estimates of Moho depth can be associated with the aspects of the structure highlighted by the particular methods. The new results allow considerable refinement of the patterns of Moho depth across the continent. Some of the thinnest crust lies beneath the Archean cratons in the Pilbara and the southern part of the Yilgarn. Thick crust is encountered beneath parts of the Proterozoic in Central Australia, and beneath the Palaeozoic Lachlan fold belt in southeastern Australia. The refined data indicate a number of zones of sharp contrast in depth to Moho, notably in the southern part of Central Australia. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors Geophysical Journal International {\textcopyright} 2011 RAS.},

abstract = {We present a new crustal thickness map of the Chinese mainland and adjacent areas based on a compilation of previously published data. More than 1900 estimates of crustal thickness from receiver function studies were collected and the weighted averages were used to develop a contour map of crustal thickness beneath the Chinese mainland. The combined dataset provided good coverage, especially over eastern and Central China, and our analysis revealed crustal thickness variations of the Chinese mainland with considerably more detail than in previous models. Our crustal thickness map shows a large variation, from a thickness of less than 30. km in the Mesozoic basin of eastern China to over 80. km in the Tibetan plateau. The thickest crust was found in central Tibet, while the thinnest continental crust was observed beneath eastern China. Normal to slightly thick crust (38-51. km) was found for the stable Precambrian basins and orogenic belts. Comparison between our model and other models reveals that the models share similar large-scale and smaller-scale features over large portions of eastern China where the data coverage is good; however, large differences (up to ±. 25. km) in crustal thickness occur in areas with complex crustal structure or poor data coverage. We also evaluated the quality of previous models by comparing them with our newly compiled point observations of crustal thickness. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The formation mechanisms for early Archaean continental crust are controversial. Continental crust may have accumulated via horizontal accretion in modern-style subduction zones or via vertical accretion above upper mantle upwelling zones. However, the characteristics of the continental crust changes at the transition between the Archaean and Proterozoic eons, suggesting that continental crust did not form in subduction zones until at least the late Archaean. Here I use seismic receiver function data to analyse the bulk properties of continental crust in Western Australia, which formed and stabilized over a billion years in the Archaean. I find that the bulk seismic properties of the crust cluster spatially, with similar clusters confined within the boundaries of tectonic terranes. I use local Archaean crustal growth models to show that both plume and subduction processes may have had a role in creating crust throughout the Archaean. A correlation between crustal age and the bulk seismic properties of the crust reveals a trend: from about 3.5 Gyr ago (Ga) to the end of the Archaean, the crust gradually thickened and simultaneously became more evolved in composition. I propose that this trend reflects the transition between crust dominantly formed above mantle plumes, to crust formed in subduction zones-a transition that may reflect secular cooling of Earth's mantle.},

The crustal thickness and the average crustal Vp/Vs ratio beneath each station are obtained by stacking Ps, PpPs and PpSs + PsPs phases coherently. The best estimated crustal thickness of Taiwan from 27 broadband stations is 30 km on average. The thinnest crust (11-15 km) is found east of the Longitude Valley suture zone, as part of the oceanic crust of the Philippine Sea plate. In other places, the crustal thickness varies from 17-19 km in northern Taiwan to 32-39 km in the southwestern island. The deepest Moho is found to be 53 km beneath station SSLB in central Taiwan. The average crustal Vp/Vs ratio in Taiwan is 1.74, with higher values of 1.74-1.99 in the north and lower values of 1.60-1.74 in the south. The crustal thickness variation is supported by gravity measurements in Taiwan and indicates that the collision between the Philippine Sea plate and Eurasian plate in Taiwan involves the whole crust. The thin crust and high Vp/Vs ratios in northern Taiwan are believed to be related to the volcanism in Tatun and Keelung located in the southwestern extent of the Okinawa Trough. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We use passive seismic and gravity data to characterize the crustal structure and the crust-mantle boundary of the east Albany-Fraser Orogen in Western Australia, a Proterozoic orogen that reworked the southern and southeastern margin of the Archean Yilgarn Craton. The crustal thickness pattern retrieved from receiver functions shows a belt of substantially thickened crust that follows the trend of the orogen, but narrows to the southwest. Common conversion point profiles show a clear transition from a wide, symmetric Moho trough in the northeast to a one-sided, northwestern Moho dip in the southwest, where the Moho appears to underthrust the craton towards its interior. This change appears to coincide with the inferred trace of the Ida Fault, a major terrane boundary within the Yilgarn Craton. Forward modelling of gravity anomaly data using the retrieved Moho geometry as a geometric constraint shows that a conspicuous, elongated gravity low on the northwestern side of the east Albany-Fraser Orogen is almost certainly caused by thickened Archean crust. To obtain a model that resembles the regional gravity pattern the following assumptions are necessary: high-density rocks occur in the upper crust of the Fraser Zone, at depth inside the Moho trough and in parts of the eastern Nornalup Zone east of the Moho trough. Although our gravity models do not constrain at which crustal level these high-density rocks occur, active deep seismic surveys suggest that large extents of the east Albany-Fraser Orogen's lower crust include a Mesoproterozoic magmatic underplate known as the Gunnadorrah Seismic Province. The simplest interpretation of the imaged crustal structure is that the Gunnadorrah Seismic Province is underthrust beneath the Yilgarn Craton, likely as a consequence of crustal shortening during accretion further east. The imaged geometry overall appears to show a wedge of Archean lower crust that was driven between the exhumed Fraser Zone and the Gunnadorrah Seismic Province, effectively splitting the Paleo- to Mesoproterozoic crust of the east Albany-Fraser Orogen. The vertical splitting of Proterozoic crust by a cratonic crustal wedge, comparable to what we image in this study, may be a process that contributed to forming many craton margins around the world.},

abstract = {We present a 3D S-velocity model for the crust and upper mantle of the South China Sea and the surrounding regions, constrained from the analysis of over 12,000 of fundamental Rayleigh wave dispersion curves between 10. s and 150. s periods. The lateral resolution was found to vary from 2° to 4° with the increasing period over the study region. A robust scheme of Debayle and Sambridge allowed us to conduct the tomographic inversion efficiently for massive datasets. Group velocity maps varying with period show lateral heterogeneities, well related to the geological and tectonic features in the study region. The 3D S-velocity model was constructed from the 1D structure inversion of the tomographic group velocity dispersion curves at each node. The obtained average crustal structure is similar to the PREM model, while the average mantle velocity is typically lower than the global average. The complicated 3D structures reveal three prominent features correlated with geological divisions: sea basin regions, island and arc regions, and continental regions. The derived crustal and lithospheric thicknesses range from ∼15 to >50. km and from ∼60 to >140. km, respectively, with the thinnest in the South China Sea, the thickest in eastern Tibet and the Yangtze Block, and the medium in the South China Fold Belt, Indochina, and island arc regions. Our results further confirm that (1) a Mesozoic subduction zone, which is interpreted as the tectonic weak zone during the Paleogene, exists along the South China margin; (2) the influence of the Indochina extrusion along the Red River Fault is limited for the South China Sea region; (3) there is a slab remnant of the proto-South China Sea beneath Borneo. New findings suggest that the Mesozoic subduction zone should be built into any evolution model for the region, as well as the other two major tectonic boundaries of the Red River Fault and proto-South China Sea subduction zone. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Teleseismic receiver functions (RFs) from a yearlong broadband seismological experiment in Kamchatka reveal regional variations in the Moho, anisotropy in the supra-slab mantle wedge, and, along the eastern coast, Ps converted phases from the steeply dipping slab. We analyze both radial- and transverse-component RFs in bin-averaged epicentral and backazimuthal sweeps, in order to detect Ps moveout and polarity variations diagnostic of interface depth, interface dip, and anisotropic fabric within the shallow mantle and crust. At some stations, the radial RF is overprinted by near-surface resonances, but anisotropic structure can be inferred from the transverse RF. Using forward modeling to match the observed RFs, we find Moho depth to range between 30 and 40 km across the peninsula, with a gradational crust-mantle transition beneath some stations along the eastern coast. Anisotropy beneath the Moho is required to fit the transverse RFs at most stations. Anisotropy in the lower crust is required at a minority of stations. Modeling the amplitude and backazimuthal variation of the Ps waveform suggests that an inclined axis of symmetry and 5-10% anisotropy are typical for the crust and the shallow mantle. The apparent symmetry axes of the anisotropic layers are typically trench-normal, but trench-parallel symmetry axes are found for stations APA and ESS, both at the fringes of the central Kamchatka depression. Transverse RFs from east-coast stations KRO, TUM, ZUP and PET are fit well by two anisotropic mantle layers with trench-normal symmetry axes and opposing tilts. Strong anisotropy in the supra-slab mantle wedge suggests that the mantle "lithosphere" beneath the Kamchatka volcanic arc is actively deforming, strained either by wedge corner flow at depth or by trenchward suction of crust as the Pacific slab retreats. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {The Precambrian rocks of Madagascar were formed and/or modified during continental collision known as the Pan-African orogeny. Aborted Permo-Triassic Karoo rifting and the subsequent separation from Africa and India resulted in the formation of sedimentary basins in the west and volcanic activity predominantly along the margins. Many geological studies have documented the imprint of these processes, but little was known about the deeper structure. We therefore deployed seismic stations along an SE-NW trending profile spanning nearly all geological domains of southern Madagascar. Here we focus on the crustal structure, which we determined based on joint analysis of receiver functions and surface waves derived from ambient noise measurements. For the sedimentary basin we document a thinning of the underlying crystalline basement by up to ∼60% to 13 km. The crustal velocity structure demonstrates that the thinning was accomplished by removal or exhumation of the lower crust. Both the Proterozoic and Archean crust have a 10 km thick upper crust and 10–12 km thick midcrust. However, in contrast to the typical structure of Proterozoic and Archean aged crust, the Archean lower crust is thicker and faster than the Proterozoic one, indicating possible magmatic intrusions; an underplated layer of 2–8 km thickness is present only below the Archean crust. The Proterozoic mafic lower crust might have been lost during continental collision by delamination or subduction or thinned as a result of extensional collapse. Finally, the Cretaceous volcanics along the east coast are characterized by thin crust (30 km) and very large VP/VS ratios.},

abstract = {The lithosphere ofMadagascar was initially amalgamated during the Pan-African events in the Neoproterozoic. It has subsequently been reshaped by extensional processes associated with the separation from Africa and India in the Jurassic and Cretaceous, respectively, and been subjected to several magmatic events in the late Cretaceous and the Cenozoic. In this study, the crust and uppermost mantle have been investigated to gain insights into the present-day structure and tectonic evolution ofMadagascar.We analysed receiver functions, computed from data recorded on 37 broad-band seismic stations, using the H-$\kappa$ stacking method and a joint inversion with Rayleigh-wave phase-velocity measurements. The thickness of the Malagasy crust ranges between 18 and 46 km. It is generally thick beneath the spine of mountains in the centre part (up to 46 km thick) and decreases in thickness towards the edges of the island. The shallowest Moho is found beneath the western sedimentary basins (18 km thick), which formed during both the Permo-Triassic Karro rifting in Gondwana and the Jurassic rifting of Madagascar from eastern Africa. The crust below the sedimentary basin thickens towards the north and east, reflecting the progressive development of the basins. In contrast, in the east there was no major rifting episode. Instead, the slight thinning of the crust along the east coast (31-36 km thick) may have been caused by crustal uplift and erosion when Madagascar moved over the Marion hotspot and India broke away from it. The parameters describing the crustal structure of Archean and Proterozoic terranes, including average thickness (40 km versus 35 km), Poisson's ratio (0.25 versus 0.26), average shear-wave velocity (both 3.7 km s-1), and thickness of mafic lower crust (7 km versus 4 km), show weak evidence of secular variation. The uppermost mantle beneathMadagascar is generally characterized by shear-wave velocities typical of stable lithosphere ($\sim$4.5 km s-1). However, markedly slow shear-wave velocities (4.2-4.3 km s-1) are observed beneath the northern tip, central part and southwestern region of the island where the major Cenozoic volcanic provinces are located, implying the lithosphere has been significantly modified in these places.},

In such areas, like the Mediterranean region, various active and passive seismic experiments are performed, locally reveal information on Moho depth, average and gradient crustal Vp velocity and average Vp/Vs velocity ratios. Until now, the most reliable information on crustal structures stems from controlled-source seismology experiments. In most parts of the Alpine region, a relatively large number of controlled-source seismology information are available though the overall coverage in the central Mediterranean area is still sparse due to high costs of such experiments. Thus, results from other seismic methodologies, such as local earthquake tomography, receiver functions and ambient noise tomography can be used to complement the controlled-source seismology information to increase coverage and thus the quality of 3-D crustal models. In this paper, we introduce a methodology to directly combine controlled-source seismology and receiver functions information relying on the strengths of each method and in relation to quantitative uncertainty estimates for all data to derive a well resolved Moho map for Italy. To obtain a homogeneous elaboration of controlledsource seismology and receiver functions results, we introduce a new classification/weighting scheme based on uncertainty assessment for receiver functions data. In order to tune the receiver functions information quality, we compare local receiver functions Moho depths and uncertainties with a recently derivedwell-resolved local earthquake tomography-derived Moho map and with controlled-source seismology information. We find an excellent correlation in the Moho information obtained by these three methodologies in Italy. In the final step, we interpolate the controlled-source seismology and receiver functions information to derive the map of Moho topography in Italy and surrounding regions. Our results show high-frequency undulation in the Moho topography of three different Moho interfaces, the European, the Adriatic-Ionian, and the Liguria-Corsica-Sardinia-Tyrrhenia, reflecting the complexity of geodynamical evolution. {\textcopyright} The Authors 2013.},

abstract = {We present a new digital crustal model for Moho depth and crustal structure in Europe, Greenland, Iceland, Svalbard, European Arctic shelf, and the North Atlantic Ocean (72W-62E, 30N-84N). Our compilation is based on digitization of original seismic profiles and Receiver Functions from ca. 650 publications which provides a dense regional data coverage. Exclusion of non-seismic data allows application of the database to potential field modeling. EUNAseis model includes Vp velocity and thickness of five crustal layers, including the sedimentary cover, and Pn velocity. For each parameter we discuss uncertainties associated with theoretical limitations, regional data quality, and interpolation.By analyzing regional trends in crustal structure and links to tectonic evolution illustrated by a new tectonic map, we conclude that: (1) Each tectonic setting shows significant variation in depth to Moho and crustal structure, essentially controlled by the age of latest tectono-thermal processes; (2) Published global averages of crustal parameters are outside of observed ranges for any tectonic setting in Europe; (3) Variation of Vp with depth in the sedimentary cover does not follow commonly accepted trends; (4) The thickness ratio between upper-middle (Vp. <. 6.8. km/s) and lower (Vp. >. 6.8. km/s) crystalline crust is indicative of crustal origin: oceanic, transitional, platform, or extended crust; (5) Continental rifting generally thins the upper-middle crust significantly without changing Vp. Lower crust experiences less thinning, also without changing Vp, suggesting a complex interplay of magmatic underplating, gabbro-eclogite phase transition and delamination; (6) Crustal structure of the Barents Sea shelf differs from rifted continental crust; and (7) Most of the North Atlantic Ocean north of 55°N has anomalously shallow bathymetry and anomalously thick oceanic crust. A belt of exceptionally thick crust (ca. 30. km) of probable oceanic origin on both sides of southern Greenland includes the Greenland-Iceland-Faeroe Ridge in the east and a similar "Baffin Ridge" feature in the west. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The lithospheric structure in Oman has been determined by analyzing teleseismic P-receiver functions recorded at broad-band and short-period seismic stations of the Oman Seismological Network. Lithospheric structure is obtained by jointly inverting receiver functions and Rayleigh wave group velocities derived from continental-scale surface wave tomography of Pasyanos. We observe relatively thick crust (40-48 km) within the ophiolite formed mountains in northern Oman. The crustal thickness is about 35 km within the passive continental margin of the southern Oman region. Uppermost (<5 km) crustal shear wave velocities are faster in the northern ophiolite regions compared to the southern Oman region, while shear velocities in the middle crust are faster in the Southern Oman region compared to the ophiolite region. This observation coincides well with cretaceous to Eocene marine platform sequences overlying Precambrian to Cambrian basement of the southern part. Joint inversion analysis shows that the Moho depth of Oman varies from 34 km in the southern region to 48 km in the northern part. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors Geophysical Journal International {\textcopyright} 2011 RAS.},

abstract = {Crustal thickness maps at regional scales are typically compiled using estimations inferred from different geophysical datasets providing a variable coverage of the investigated area. Consequently, spurious effects related to changes in data resolution or artifacts in grid interpolation may affect significant zones of those maps. The TopoIberia-IberArray broad-band seismic network, covering the Iberian Peninsula and Northern Morocco with stations distributed on a regular 60 × 60 km grid provides a unique opportunity to avoid such technical problems and to obtain a crustal thickness map derived from a same method sampling evenly all the region. Data from more than 340 stations has been gathered and analyzed using the P-to-S conversion phases at the Moho discontinuity (receiver functions). The crustal thickness has been inferred applying the classical H-$\kappa$ stacking technique, though in regions of complex crustal structure, we have preferred to estimate the thickness directly from the arrival time of the converted phase at some sites.The topography of the Moho discontinuity is strongly correlated with tectonic processes. The investigated area, extending from the Sahara platform to the Bay of Biscay, has a great geodynamic diversity, including, North to South, crustal imbrication in the Pyrenean and Cantabrian range, a large and relatively undisturbed Variscan Massif in the center of Iberia and areas of complex and still not completely understood geodynamics in the Alboran crust domain and the Atlas range. The crustal thickness map reflects this diversity, showing variations reaching 30. km between the thickest and thinnest zones of continental crust. The final map has an overall similarity with previous estimations of the crustal thickness using independent data, as those coming from more sparse deep seismic sounding profiles, but provides further constraints at regional scale.},

abstract = {We analyse P-wave receiver functions across the western Gulf of Aden and southern Red Sea continental margins inWestern Yemen to constrain crustal thickness, internal crustal structure and the bulk seismic velocity characteristics in order to address the role of magmatism, faulting and mechanical crustal thinning during continental breakup.We analyse teleseismic data from 21 stations forming the temporary Young ConjugateMargins Laboratory (YOCMAL) network together with GFZ and Yemeni permanent stations. Analysis of computed receiver functions shows that (1) the thickness of unextended crust on the Yemen plateau is $\sim$35 km; (2) this thins to $\sim$22 km in coastal areas and reaches less than 14 km on the Red Sea coast, where presence of a high-velocity lower crust is evident. The average Vp/Vs ratio for the western Yemen Plateau is 1.79, increasing to $\sim$1.92 near the Red Sea coast and decreasing to 1.68 for those stations located on or near the granitic rocks. Thinning of the crust, and by inference extension, occurs over a $\sim$130-km-wide transition zone from the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden coasts to the edges of the Yemen plateau. Thinning of continental crust is particularly localized in a < 30-km-wide zone near the coastline, spatially co-incident with addition of magmatic underplate to the lower crust, above which on the surface we observe the presence of seaward dipping reflectors (SDRs) and thickened Oligo- Miocene syn-rift basaltic flows. Our results strongly suggest the presence of high-velocity mafic intrusions in the lower crust, which are likely either synrift magmatic intrusion into continental lower crust or alternatively depleted upper mantle underplated to the base of the crust during the eruption of the SDRs. Our results also point towards a regional breakup history in which the onset of rifting was synchronous along the western Gulf of Aden and southern Red Sea volcanic margins followed by a second phase of extension along the Red Sea margin. {\textcopyright} The Authors 2013.

abstract = {This study investigates crustal characteristics beneath the western United States. Crustal parameters, including crustal thickness (H), mean Vp/Vs, and the sharpness of the Moho as quantified by the amplitude of the P-to-S converted phases from the Moho, are measured at a total of 1000 permanent and portable broadband seismic stations using over 150,000 receiver functions recorded between 1988 and 2012. The study area is composed of a diverse set of tectonic provinces formed by a series of tectonic events, and is thus ideal for investigating crustal formation and modification by different tectonic processes. The resulting crustal thickness varies from 21 km in the Pacific Border to 57 km beneath the Rocky Mountains, with a mean thickness of 38.5±1.8 km. The Vp/Vs varies from 1.70 in the Great Plains to 1.90 in the Columbia River Basalt Group (north Columbia Plateau), with a mean value of 1.77±0.014. We explore relationship between crustal thickness, Vp/Vs, surface elevation, and the age of the crust, and find no positive relationship between crustal thickness and Vp/Vs. In addition, no clear connections between the Vp/Vs and the crustal age are found. High Vp/Vs and relatively low R values are observed at locations with crustal partial melts inferred by seismic tomography, such as Yellowstone, the eastern Snake River Plain, and the southeastern portion of the Rio Grande Rift. Moreover, secondary arrivals that arrive before the P-to-S conversion from the Moho and probably reflect the top of the so-called 7.xx layer, are observed beneath the Cheyenne Belt, boundary of Snake River Plain and Basin Range, as well as beneath the Wyoming craton, Colorado Plateau, and Delaware Basin.},

abstract = {The interpretation of a deep seismic refraction study in Jordan, performed in May 1984, shows that much of the country is underlain by continental crust, 32-35 km thick, and normal mantle with a velocity of 8.0-8.2 km/s. In the Aqaba region, southwest and central Jordan, east of Wadi Araba, the crustal thickness is of the order of 32-35 km, while in the Amman region it is not less than 35 km. In southeast Jordan the crust thickens to at least 37 km in what is probably the transition to the Arabian Shield type of crust. The boundaries between the upper and lower crust at about 20 km depth and the lower crust and uppermost mantle are probably transition zones. The upper crystalline crust has velocities of 5.8-6.5 km/s while the lower crust has velocities greater than or around 6.65 km/s. While the crystalline basement is exposed in southwest Jordan and is at a depth of 2-2.5 km north of Amman, it is at a depth of not less than 5 km in central Jordan. A comparison of the crustal type and structure of Jordan and the adjacent Dead Sea rift with that of the Black Forest and the Rhine valley yields a striking resemblance. The situation of the Jordan-Dead Sea rift is explained in terms of the continental crust of Arabia rifting in preference to the thin (?oceanic) crust of the Mediterranean Sea. {\textcopyright} 1987.},

abstract = {The unique tectonic setting of the Oman Mountains and the Semail Ophiolite, together with ongoing hydrocarbon exploration, have focused geological research on the sedimentary and ophiolite stratigraphy of Oman. However, there have been few investigations of the crustal-scale structure of the eastern Arabian continental margin. In order to rectify this omission, we made a 255-km-long, southwesterly oriented crustal transect of the Oman Mountains from the Coastal Zone to the interior Foreland via the 3,000-m-high Jebel Akhdar. The model for the upper 8 km of the crust was constrained using 152 km of 2-D seismic reflection profiles, 15 exploratory wells, and 1:100,000- to 1:250,000-scale geological maps. Receiver-function analysis of teleseismic earthquake waveform data from three temporary digital seismic stations gave the first reliable estimates of depth-to-Moho. Bouguer gravity modeling provided further evidence of depths to the Moho and metamorphic basement. Four principal results were obtained from the transect. (1) An interpreted mountain root beneath Jebel Akhdar has a lateral extent of about 60 km along the transect. The depth-to-Moho of 41 to 44 km about 25 km southwest of Jebel Akhdar increased to 48 to 51 km on its northeastern side but decreased to 39 to 42 km beneath the coastal plain farther to the northeast. (2) The average depth to the metamorphic basement was inferred from Bouguer gravity modeling to be 9 km in the core of Jebel Akhdar and immediately to the southwest. A relatively shallow depth-to-basement of 7 to 8 km coincided with the Jebel Qusaybah anticline south of the Hamrat Ad Duru Range. (3) Based on surface, subsurface, and gravity modeling, the Nakhl Ophiolite block extends seaward for approximately 80 km from its most southerly outcrop. It has an average thickness of about 5 km, whereas ophiolite south of Jebel Akhdar is only 1 km thick. The underlying Hawasina Sediments are between 2 and 3 km thick in the Hamrat Ad Duru Zone, and 2 km thick in the Coastal Zone. (4) Southwest of Jebel Akhdar, reactivated NW-oriented strike-slip basement faults that deformed Miocene to Pliocene sediments were inferred from the interpretation of seismic reflection profiles.},

abstract = {In 1998-1999, a large-scale seismic array was deployed in Finland as a part of the EUROPROBE/SVEKALAPKO subproject, involving 14 European universities and research institutes. The objective of the project was to map the deep lithosphere structure and thickness beneath the Fennoscandian Shield by means of teleseismic events. In addition, about 580 local seismic events were registered during the data acquisition period. Among them, only eight local earthquakes were recorded, the rest being quarry blasts from mining sites in Russia, Finland, Estonia and Sweden. In this study, we present the analysis of the seismic wave field from the strongest local events registered by the majority of the stations of the SVEcofennian-KArelian-LAPland-KOla Transect (SVEKALAPKO) array with the aim of mapping the structure of the upper mantle beneath the array. For this purpose, we selected the events corresponding to a single source type and compared these recordings with those from wide-angle reflection and refraction experiments in the area to identify the regional phases. The record sections of selected events demonstrate strong reflections (PmP) from the Moho boundary. The refracted Pn phases can be seen as first arrivals at distances of about 200-400 km from the source. At offsets of about 400-800 km, phases reflected from inhomogeneities in the uppermost mantle (P1) and double reflections from the Moho boundary (PmPPmP) were recorded. Results from 2D forward ray trace modeling of reflected and refracted P-waves along four profile swathes from SVEKALAPKO stations demonstrate that the mantle reflections originate from two different groups of boundaries beneath the array: one group of phases arrive from subhorizontal and gently dipping reflectors below the Moho boundary at a depth of 70-90 km, while the other group are phases originating from a depth of 100 to 130 km. Based on the irregular character of the first group of reflections, their different spatial orientation and correlation with the Moho offsets, we interpret the boundaries of this group as relicts of ancient subduction and collision processes. The second group of reflections can be explained by a transition from mechanically strong to mechanically weak lithosphere. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We present a new data set of Moho depth estimates for peninsular Italy, obtained from receiver functions analysis and a grid search approach. Teleseismic records from 174 broadband seismic stations were used to compute the receiver function data set. In general, our results agree well with previous knowledge, adding original information in many regions where previous data were lacking or uncertain. We find broad regions with consistent Moho depth, namely, (1) the peri-Tyrrhenian areas bordering the homonymous sea have a 20 to 25 km deep Moho; (2) the foreland regions (Adriatic, Apulia, Iblean) with 30–35 km deep Moho; (3) the Apennines belt, where we find westward deepening of the Adriatic Moho down to 50 km depth, that well delineate the westward Adria subduction, overlayed by the shallow Tyrrhenian Moho; (4) Calabria shows a flat, 40 km deep Moho suddenly dipping at high angle from the Tyrrhenian coast westward, defining the Ionian subduction; and (5) a clear separation between northern and southern Apennines is marked by a region of almost flat Moho, possible evidence of a detached slab in between. We also find that in the northern Apennines the shallow Tyrrhenian Moho is continuous for more than 200 km from the sea to under the northern Apennines, with a generally flat geometry and a few undulations suggesting either the ‘‘boudinage'' or episodic pulses of extension of the Tyrrhenian crust during its Pliocene-Quaternary stretching. The eastward extent of the Tyrrhenian Moho below the Apenninic belt approximately corresponds to the eastward extent of the observed extension in the upper crust as mapped by the normal faulting earthquakes. In this portion of the Apennines, we interpret an intracrustal discontinuity, SW dipping below the belt parallel to the Adria Moho, as the top of the lower crust being subducted beneath the Apennines. The ‘‘subcrustal'' earthquakes of this region (down to 80 km depth) seem to be located within this subducted crustal layer. The southern Apennines show the same general geometry of subduction as the northern arc, although the former have a less defined on-land extended region and no earthquakes in the lower crust–uppermost mantle. In between, the central Apennines present a different Moho geometry: no clear doubling of the two plates but rather a constant bilateral deepening possibly associated to a crustal root, with no evidence of a subduction setting. This reinforces the hypothesis of a detached slab in this area. We also present the first large-scale mapping of average crustal Vp/Vs ratios for peninsular Italy. The results, although representing averages over the whole crust, enhance some interesting features. The most evident are belts of high Vp/Vs in the thinned crust of the Apennines where extension has long been active in the Quaternary, probably as an effect of highly fractured rocks with abundant fluid circulation. Strong correlation exists between areas of high Vp/Vs and Quaternary volcanoes, suggesting the presence of fluids at depth.},

The results confirm the presence of crustal roots at the north and south of Iranian Plateau where it meets the Arabian Plate and Eurasia. The high velocity lithosphere of the Arabian Plate gently plunges NNE-ward beneath Central Iran supporting the subduction of the continental lithosphere responsible for the seismicity of the area. The crust and lithosphere are thinner beneath Central Iran, where two low velocity structures are very likely related to magma sources of the UDMA and in east of Iran, around Lut block, where the volcanism shows calcalkaline subduction-related geochemistry. The crustal-lithospheric root to the north of the Iranian Plateau may represent the relict of a previous "cimmeric" subduction zone. Therefore the Iranian lithosphere-asthenosphere system could be the result of the coalescence of two separate subduction zones.},

abstract = {The Alborz Mountains of northern Iran form a belt of active crustal deformation along the southern side of the Caspian Sea within the broad Arabian-Eurasia continental collision zone. Although the range has an average elevation of about 3000 m with the volcanic peak Damavand reaching an elevations of 5671 m, early gravity studies found that the crust beneath the range is no thicker than that beneath the surrounding region suggesting the range is not supported by a crustal root. We determine a model for the crust of the central Alborz Mountains using teleseismic receiver functions from data recorded on a network of broad-band seismographs temporarily deployed across the central part of the range. The receiver functions from these recordings have been inverted simultaneously with fundamental-mode Rayleigh wave group velocity measurements in the 10-100 s period range. Our analysis shows a thickening of the crust from $\sim$48 km beneath the northern part of the Central Iranian Plateau to 55-58 km below the central part of the Alborz Mountains, then a thinning of the crust to $\sim$46 km north of the Alborz Mountains beneath the coastal region of the South Caspian Sea. Our seismological results show that the central Alborz Mountains have a moderate crustal root but of insufficient thickness to compensate the elevation of the range. The analysis of free-air gravity shows that the elevation of the Alborz Mountains is largely supported by the elastic strength of the Iranian Plate, the South Caspian Plate, or both. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2010 RAS.},

abstract = {We present a study on the depth to basement and magnetic crustal domains beneath the Iranian Plateau by modeling aeromagnetic and gravity data. First, field processing of the aeromagnetic data was undertaken to estimate the general characteristics of the magnetic basement. Afterwards, inverse modeling of aeromagnetic data was carried out to estimate the depth to basement. The obtained model of basement was refined using combined gravity and magnetic forward modeling. Hereby, we were able to distinguish different magnetic domains in the uppermost crust (10–20 km depths) influencing the medium to long wavelength trends of the magnetic anomalies. Magnetic basement mapping shows that prominent shallow magnetic features are furthermore located in the volcanic areas, e.g. the Urumieh Dokhtar Magmatic Assemblage. The presence of ophiolite outcrops in SE Iran implies that shallow oceanic crust (with high magnetization) is the main source of one of the biggest magnetic anomalies in entire Iran area located north of the Makran.},

abstract = {We jointly invert teleseismic radial-component receiver functions and regional Rayleigh and Love surface-wave group velocities for 1-D shear-wave velocity structure beneath station TBZ located on the northern side of the eastern Pontides. An influence factor is employed to control the relative influence of receiver function and surface-wave dispersion on the resultant velocity-depth profile. Radial- and transverse-component receiver functions at station TBZ exhibit an azimuthal amplitude and polarity pattern consistent with 2-D receiver structure that has a general dip direction towards approximately south. The radial-component receiver functions are least affected by the dipping structures along the strike direction and thereby we prefer teleseismic events sampling along-strike structures to alleviate the deflecting effect of dipping interfaces on the 1-D solution. The 1-D inversion effectively reveals the two-layer nature of the crust which is perturbed by high- and low-velocity layers, and serves as a provisional model for the 2-D forward modelling. Minor-to-moderate changes to the 1-D model, such as changing depth to and velocity contrast across an interface, are needed to achieve the results with the 2-D modelling. Dipping interfaces and seismic anisotropy are included in the 2-D modelling to fit both radial- and transverse-component receiver functions. The upper crust is characterized by a shear velocity of ∼3.5 km s-1 and cut through by a 4 km thick high-velocity (i.e. ∼3.8 km s-1) layer. Overlying the upper crust, the sedimentary cover (i.e. the top 5 km) has velocities within the range ∼2.0-3.5 kms-1. A mid-crustal velocity discontinuity between the upper granitic crust and the lower basaltic crust is identified at ∼16-km depth. This boundary is analogous to the mid-crustal discontinuity found under the Black Sea basin across which the shear velocity jumps from 3.5 to 4.1 km s-1. A relatively thick (i.e. ∼12 km) low-velocity layer in the lower crust with a velocity reversal from 4.1 to 3.7 km s-1 is needed to better explain reverberations off this depth range. We infer a 2-D Moho discontinuity placed at ∼35-km depth beneath the station. The proposed dip angle for the Moho is rather steep (i.e. ∼25°), although coincident with regional gravity studies. The associated Sn velocity (i.e. ∼4.4 km s-1) is rather low, indicating disturbed upper-mantle structure beneath the region. Initial amplitudes of transverse-component receiver functions are rather energetic, for which we propose substantial P and S velocity anisotropy (∼12 per cent) for the topmost depths (<5 km).},

abstract = {We computed P and S receiver functions to investigate the lithospheric structure beneath the northwest Iran and compute the Vp/Vs ratio within the crust of this seismologically active area. Our results enabled us to map the lateral variations of the Moho as well as those of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) beneath this region. We selected data from teleseismic events (Mb > 5.5, epicentral distance between 30° and 95° for P receiver functions and Mb > 5.7, epicentral distance between 60° and 85° for S receiver functions) recorded from 1995 to 2008 at 8 three-component short-period stations of Tabriz Telemetry Seismic Network. Our results obtained from P receiver functions indicate clear conversions at the Moho boundary. The Moho depth was firstly estimated from the delay time of the Moho converted phase relative to the direct P wave. Then we used the H-Vp/Vs stacking algorithm of Zhu and Kanamori to estimate the crustal thickness and Vp/Vs ratio underneath the stations with clear Moho multiples. We found an average Moho depth of 48 km, which varies between 38.5 and 53 km. The Moho boundary showed a significant deepening towards east and north. This may reveal a crustal thickening towards northeast possibly due to the collision between the Central Iran and South Caspian plates. The obtained average Vp/Vs ratio was estimated to be 1.76, which varies between 1.73 and 1.82. The crustal structure was also determined by modeling of P receiver functions. We obtained a three-layered model for the crust beneath this area. The thickness of the layers is estimated to be 6-11, 18-35, and 38-53 km, respectively. The average of the shear wave velocity was calculated to be 3.4 km/s in the crust and reaches 4.3 km/s below the Moho discontinuity. The crustal thickness values obtained from P receiver functions are in good agreement with those derived by S receiver functions. In addition, clear conversions with negative polarity were observed at $\sim$8.7 s in S receiver functions, which could be related to the conversion at the LAB. This may show a relatively thin continental lithosphere of about 85 km implying that the lithosphere was influenced by various geodynamical reworking processes in the past. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Waveforms of 50 teleseismic receiver functions and dispersion curves have been used to invert jointly for the 1D average crust and uppermost mantle seismic structure beneath GEOFON station ISP. The surface wave (Rayleigh and Love) dispersion curves were adopted from an earlier study and greatly help to stabilize the inversions by alleviating the deficiencies of inverting the receiver functions alone. The teleseismic receiver functions had a backazimuth distribution from which three stacks were created. All the stacks resulted in compatible inversions. Nine different influence factors ranging between 0.1 and 0.9 were employed and the influence factors around 0.5 were preferred for producing a reasonable seismic structure to represent the geology under station ISP. Three distinct crustal depth ranges are identified based on the inverted velocity-depth profile. The first corresponds to 0-5 km where the velocity-depth profile has a positive gradient with an increase from 2.5 km s-1 to 3.0 km s-1. The second depth range is 5-10 km and the velocity-depth profile shows a positive gradient between 3.0 km s-1 and 3.20 km s-1. A velocity jump from 3.20 km s-1 to 3.62 km s-1 tops the third depth range (10-20 km), which is characterized by a constant velocity. There is another velocity drop at 20 km depth from 3.62 km s-1 to 3.40 km s-1 and the low velocity therein is persistent down to 27.5 km. Below this depth range, the shear velocity increases until 40 km depth where the Moho discontinuity is estimated with Sn velocity of 4.4 km s-1. In general, seismic velocities under SW Anatolia are considerably slower than those of the Preliminary Reference Earth Model (PREM). {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The teleseismic P receiver functions are customarily inverted to attain the seismic velocities beneath a seismic station. Surface wave dispersion data are often added to reduce the effect of the non-uniqueness. The combination of P receiver function and surface wave works well in resolving the structures in the crust and uppermost mantle, but is less effective in characterizing greater (lithosphere and asthenosphere) depths due to the interference from crustal multiples. A solution to this problem is jointly to model teleseismic S receiver functions with surface wave and P receiver functions. This study adopts a fast, one-dimensional (1-D) inversion scheme. To avoid the effect of multidimensional structures away from the seismic station, we eliminate multiples that reverberate between the surface and interfaces below a restriction depth (RD), as well as S-to-P conversions below an inversion depth (ID). P-to-S conversions off the interfaces above the half-space and S-to-P conversions above the ID and multiples above the RD are properly modelled. This approach favours ray paths travelling close to stations and is, therefore, more suitable for 1-D inversions. We perform numerical experiments with and without noise and highlight the advantages of a joint receiver function and surface wave analysis. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {The Red Sea Rift, an archetype of a newly formed ocean basin, is an ideal environment in which to study the controversial processes associated with continental rifting. Different models have been proposed to explain how rifting in the Red Sea evolved; however, accurate constraints on lithospheric structure have not been available to discriminate rifting models. We use the S-wave receiver function technique to produce the first images of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) structure along the Red Sea and throughout the Arabian Peninsula. Lithospheric thickness varies considerably, with thin lithosphere centered on the rift axis, thickening toward the Arabian interior. Gravity data are well fit by our structural model and indicate that high surface topography along the rift flank is not in isostatic equilibrium, requiring dynamic compensation for its support. While our derived structure is consistent with active rifting processes, previous studies demonstrated that the Red Sea initiated as a passive rift. Therefore, our results suggest a two-stage rifting history, where extension and erosion by flow in the underlying asthenosphere are responsible for variations in LAB depth. LAB topography guides asthenospheric flow beneath western Arabia and the Red Sea, demonstrating the important role lithospheric variations play in the thermal modification of tectonic environments. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Teleseismic data observed at seven broad-band stations located in and adjacent to the Sinai subplate were analysed using the receiver function method for estimating the velocity structure of the crust and upper mantle. The receiver function method is based on the analysis and interpretation of P-S converted phases and associated surface multiples that originate at seismic discontinuities beneath the receiver. The main converted P-S phases are from the base of a near-surface sedimentary layer located in the upper crust, at the Moho, in the subMoho upper mantle, at the 410- and 660-km seismic discontinuities. The velocity structure of the crust and the upper mantle varies within the Sinai subplate. A complicated crustal structure is suggested for the Cyprus arc, which marks the northern boundary of the Sinai subplate, with a Moho depth of 28 km. In the area of the Dead Sea Fault (DSF), which marks the eastern boundary of the Sinai subplate, Moho depth increases from north to south from approximately 27 km beneath station MRNI located in northern Israel to approximately 34 km beneath station EIL located north of the Gulf of Aqaba. Away from the DSF, a crustal thickness of 34-36 km is indicated at HITJ located in the Arabian Plate and KEG located in the African Plate. A low-velocity zone (LVZ) beginning at approximately 60-km depth is inferred beneath stations located close to the DSF. This boundary is interpreted as the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB). The shallow LAB may be the top of a highly deformed mantle zone and may have facilitated the formation of the DSF some 15 Ma. {\textcopyright} 2004 RAS.},

abstract = {An analysis of the shear (S) waves recorded during the wide-angle reflection/refraction (WRR) experiment as part of the DESERT project crossing the Dead Sea Transform (DST) reveals average crustal S-wave velocities of 3.3-3.5 km s-1 beneath the WRR profile. Together with average crustal P-wave velocities of 5.8-6.1 km s-1 from an already published study this provides average crustal Poisson's ratios of 0.26-0.27 (Vp/Vs = 1.76-1.78) below the profile. The top two layers consisting predominantly of sedimentary rocks have S-wave velocities of 1.8-2.7 km s-1 and Poisson's ratios of 0.25-0.31 (Vp/Vs = 1.73-1.91). Beneath these two layers the seismic basement has average S-wave velocities of around 3.6 km s-1 east of the DST and about 3.7 km s-1 west of the DST and Poisson's ratios of 0.24-0.25 (Vp/Vs = 1.71-1.73). The lower crust has an average S-wave velocity of about 3.75 km s-1 and an average Poisson's ratio of around 0.27 (Vp/Vs = 1.78). No Sn phase refracted through the uppermost mantle was observed. The results provide for the first time information from controlled source data on the crustal S-wave velocity structure for the region west of the DST in Israel and Palestine and agree with earlier results for the region east of the DST in the Jordanian highlands. A shear wave splitting study using SKS waves has found evidence for crustal anisotropy beneath the WRR profile while a receiver function study has found evidence for a lower crustal, high S-wave velocity layer east of the DST below the profile. Although no evidence was found in the S-wave data for either feature, the S-wave data are not incompatible with crustal anisotropy being present as the WRR profile only lies 30° off the proposed symmetry axis of the anisotropy where the difference in the two S-wave velocities is still very small. In the case of the lower crustal, high S-wave velocity layer, if the velocity change at the top of this layer comprises a small first-order discontinuity underlain by a 2 km thick transition zone, instead of just a large first-order discontinuity, then both the receiver function data and the WRR data presented here can be satisfied. Finally, the S-wave velocities and Poisson's ratios which have been derived in this study are typical of continental crust and do not require extensional processes to explain them. {\textcopyright} 2005 RAS.},

Our aims are to use results from the 3-D seismic array to map crustal stretching across and along the Aden margin in southern Oman. The array recorded local and teleseismic events between 2003 March and 2004 March. Seventy-eight events were used in our joint inversions for Vp/Vs ratio and depth. The major results are: (1) Crustal thickness decreases from the uplifted rift flank of the margin towards the Sheba mid-ocean ridge. We found a crustal thickness of about 35 km beneath the northern rift flank. This value decreases sharply to 26 km beneath the post-rift subsidence zone on the Salalah coastal plain. This 10 km of crustal thinning occurs across a horizontal distance of less than 30 km showing a localization of the crustal thinning below the first known rifted block of the margin. (2) A second rift margin transect located about 50 km to the east shows no thinning from the coast to 50 km onshore. The lack of crustal thickness variation indicates that the maximum crustal stretching could be restricted to offshore regions. (3) The along-strike variations in crustal structure demonstrate the scale and longevity of the regular along-axis rift segmentation. (4) Extension is still observed north of the rifted domain, 70 km onshore from the coast, making the width of margin larger than first expected from geology. (5) The crust has a felsic to normal composition with a probably strong effect of the sedimentary layer on the Vp/Vs ratio (comprised between 1.67 and 1.91). {\textcopyright} 2007 The Authors Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2007 RAS.},

abstract = {To address one of the central questions of plate tectonics-How do large transform systems work and what are their typical features?-seismic investigations across the Dead Sea Transform (DST), the boundary between the African and Arabian plates in the Middle East, were conducted for the first time. A major component of these investigations was a combined reflection/refraction survey across the territories of Palestine, Israel and Jordan. The main results of this study are: (1) The seismic basement is offset by 3-5 km under the DST, (2) The DST cuts through the entire crust, broadening in the lower crust, (3) Strong lower crustal reflectors are imaged only on one side of the DST, (4) The seismic velocity sections show a steady increase in the depth of the crust-mantle transition (Moho) from ∼26 km at the Mediterranean to ∼39 km under the Jordan highlands, with only a small but visible, asymmetric topography of the Moho under the DST. These observations can be linked to the left-lateral movement of 105 km of the two plates in the last 17 Myr, accompanied by strong deformation within a narrow zone cutting through the entire crust. Comparing the DST and the San Andreas Fault (SAF) system, a strong asymmetry in subhorizontal lower crustal reflectors and a deep reaching deformation zone both occur around the DST and the SAF. The fact that such lower crustal reflectors and deep deformation zones are observed in such different transform systems suggests that these structures are possibly fundamental features of large transform plate boundaries. {\textcopyright} 2004 RAS.},

The present-day Iranian plateau is characterized by diverse tectonic domains including the continental collisions (e.g. Zagros and Alborz) and the oceanic plate subduction (e.g. Makran). Partitioned waveform inversion method is used here to image the S-velocity structure of the upper-mantle and Moho-depth variations in the Iranian plateau. Of nearly 3000 waveforms originally selected for the analysis, we have fitted 974 waveforms from 101 events and 39 stations which result in 11 688 linear constraints on the upper-mantle S-velocity structure and Moho depth for the region.Our new seismic images show seismically faster upper mantle beneath the Zagros and the Arabian Plate compared to the Central Iran and Alborz. This high-velocity anomaly has descended beneath the Central Iran along the Main Zagros Thrust. Across the Zagros collision zone, the tomographic images show a slab stagnation in the transition zone (at about 410 km depth) in the form of a horizontal high-velocity zone which does not penetrate the deeper parts of the mantle. The lowest S-velocities are concentrated beneath the Central Iran and Alborz. According to our velocity models, a strong high-velocity anomaly is resolved beneath the trapped South Caspian Basin with clear indication of westward underthrusting beneath the Talesh and western Alborz. In Makran, southeast Iran, there is a clear evidence of subduction of oceanic crust of the Arabian plate beneath the Makran belt which is correlated with seismicity pattern across the Makran zone. Also, the inverted Moho map using a priori information of crustal thickness constraints shows the large crustal thickness beneath the Zagros suture zone (in some places to a maximum depth of 65 km) which indicates the influence of crustal thickening and shortening beneath Arabian-Eurasian Plate boundary. A significantly crustal thinning is observable across the South Caspian Basin compared to its margins. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors Geophysical Journal International {\textcopyright} 2010 RAS.},

We found an average crustal thickness of 45 km and an average crustal shear velocity of 3.7 km/s for the entire eastern Anatolian plateau. Within the Anatolian plateau we found evidence of a prominent low velocity zone where the crust thickness is approximately 46 km. These results suggests that the 2 km high topography across the Anatolian plateau is dynamically supported because most of the plateau appears to be isostatically under-compensated. Also, there appears to be a region of thin crust at the easternmost edge of the Anatolian plateau that may be a relic from the accretion of island arcs to the Eurasian plate.

abstract = {We installed 5 broadband and 45 short-period temporary seismic stations, distributed partly as a dense, 100-km-long, N-S linear array and partly as a regional network, throughout the Menderes Massif of western Turkey in order to study crust-upper mantle structure and seismicity. In this study, we have combined teleseismic waveform data from these stations with data from several permanent seismic stations to determine crustal thickness variations in the Aegean region. Receiver function studies at seven broadband stations, using the H-$\kappa$, stacking method, have yielded crustal thicknesses and Vp/Vs ratios over a broad region of the Aegean. A more detailed crustal image was obtained in the central Menderes Massif, where we applied common conversion point stacking to receiver functions obtained from the N-S linear array. The results show a general trend of westward crustal thinning from 36 km in central Anatolia to 28-30 km in the central Menderes Massif to 25 km beneath the Aegean Sea. The results also indicate that crustal thinning in the Aegean is not uniform in the N-S extensional direction. The crust is thinner in the central Menderes Massif (28-30 km of crustal thicknesses) and the Cycladic Massif (25-26 km) than in surrounding regions where, crustal thicknesses are 32-34 km. The long-lived elevated Moho under the metamorphic core complexes suggests that the lower crust in the Aegean region is at least 3 times more viscous than that in the Basin and Range Province, where the Moho is much flatter.

The stacked single-event receiver functions were modelled by an inversion algorithm based on a five-layered crustal velocity model to reveal the first-order shear-velocity discontinuities with a minimum degree of trade-off. We observe crustal thickening from west (29-32 km) to east (34-35 km) along the North Anatolian Fault Zone (NAFZ), but we observe no obvious crustal thickness variation from north to south while crossing the NAFZ. The crust is thinnest beneath station TER (29 km), located near the Black Sea coast in the west and thickest beneath station TAR (35 km), located inland in the southeast. The average crustal thickness and S-wave velocity for the whole regions are 31 ± 2 km and 3.64 ± 0.15 km s-1, respectively. The eastern Marmara region with its average crustal thickness, high heat flow value (101 ± 11 mW m-2) and with its remarkable extensional features seems to have a Basin and Range type characteristics, but the higher average shear velocities (∼3.64 km s-1) and crustal thickening from 29 to 35 km towards the easternmost stations indicate that the crustal structure shows a transitional tectonic regime. Therefore, we conclude that the eastern Marmara region seems to be a transition zone between the Marmara Sea extensional domain and the continental Anatolian inland region. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Authors Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2006 RAS.},

abstract = {In this receiver function study, we investigate the structure of the crust beneath six seismic broadband stations close to the Sunda Arc formed by subduction of the Indo-Australian under the Sunda plate. We apply three different methods to analyse receiver functions at single stations. A recently developed algorithm determines absolute shear-wave velocities from observed frequency-dependent apparent incidence angles of P waves. Using waveform inversion of receiver functions and a modified Zhu and Kanamori algorithm, properties of discontinuities such as depth, velocity contrast, and sharpness are determined. The combination of the methods leads to robust results. The approach is validated by synthetic tests. Stations located on Malaysia show high-shear-wave velocities (VS) near the surface in the range of 3.4-3.6 km s-1 attributed to crystalline rocks and 3.6-4.0 km s-1 in the lower crust. Upper and lower crust are clearly separated, the Moho is found at normal depths of 30-34 km where it forms a sharp discontinuity at station KUM or a gradient at stations IPM and KOM. For stations close to the subduction zone (BSI, GSI and PSI) complexity within the crust is high. Near the surface low VS of 2.6-2.9 km s-1 indicate sediment layers. High VS of 4.2 km s-1 are found at depth greater than 6 and 2 km at BSI and PSI, respectively. There, the Moho is located at 37 and 40 km depth. At station GSI, situated closest to the trench, the subducting slab is imaged as a north-east dipping structure separated from the sediment layer by a 10 km wide gradient in VS between 10 and 20 km depth. Within the subducting slab VS ≈ 4. 7 km s-1. At station BSI, the subducting slab is found at depth between 90 and 110 km dipping 20° ± 8° in approximately N 60° E. A velocity increase in similar depth is indicated at station PSI, however no evidence for a dipping layer is found. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {We report the crustal structure for two locations in Iraq estimated by joint inversion of P-wave receiver functions (RFs) and surface (Rayleigh) wave group velocity dispersion. RFs were computed from teleseismic recordings at two temporary broad-band seismic stations located in Mosul (MSL) in the Zagros Fold Belt and Baghdad (BHD) in the Mesopotamian Foredeep. Group velocity dispersion curves at the sites were derived from continental-scale tomography. The inversion results show that the crustal thicknesses are 39 km at MSL and 43 km at BHD. We observe a strong Ps Moho at BHD consistent with a sharp Moho discontinuity. However, at MSL we observe a weak Ps Moho suggesting a transitional Moho where crustal thickening is likely to be occurring in the deep crust. Both sites reveal low velocity surface layers consistent with sedimentary thickness of about 3 km at station MSL and 7 km at BHD and agreeing well with the previous reports. Ignoring the sediments, the crystalline crustal velocities and thicknesses are remarkably similar at both stations. The similarity of crustal structure suggests that the crust of the northeastern proto-Arabian Platform was uniform before subsidence and deposition of the sediments in the Cenozoic. If crystalline crustal structure is uniform across the northern Arabian Platform then crustal thickness variations in the Zagros Fold Belt and Thrust Zone should reveal the history of deformation and crustal shortening in the Arabian-Eurasian collision zone and not reflect pre-existing crustal thickness variations in the Arabian Plate. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Authors Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2007 RAS.},

abstract = {Two-hundred and sixty-seven teleseismic events with a moment magnitude greater than 5.5 which occurred between January 2005 and October 2010 were analyzed to determine the Moho depth variation beneath Turkey by using the Receiver Function (RF) technique. The RF technique was applied to 120 broadband seismic stations, which were already deployed in the area permanently by the Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake Research Institute (KOERI) and the Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD). The RFs were stacked considering back-azimuth, slowness and waveform similarities to enhance the signal/noise ratio. The genetic algorithm (GA) was used to obtain both 1-D shear-wave speed model and the Moho depth beneath each seismic station. A data set consisting of 112 shear-speed models derived from RFs revealed the crustal structure of Turkey. For imaging, several 2-D profiles of depth-migrated RFs were constructed to delineate the fine crustal structure. The Moho discontinuity is clearly seen on all profiles and the mid-crustal velocity discontinuity within the crust is observed in some profiles. The depth of the Moho varies between 24 and 48. km. The thinnest crustal thickness is located on the coast of Western Turkey, and the deepest Moho boundary is observed in Eastern Turkey. The shear wave velocities vary between 4.0. km/s and 4.5. km/s in the uppermost mantle beneath Turkey. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The genetic algorithm is adopted to avoid the inherent non-uniqueness problems of the inversion. The total of 50 teleseismic waveforms recorded by 25 permanent stations is analyzed and the selected records of earthquakes distributed in three quadrants from each seismic station in the years from 2007 to 2008 are analyzed. 2-D images of Moho variation beneath the western Turkey along two profiles are 700 and 300. km long and extended from the Aegean Sea coast to the central Anatolia and southeastern Anatolia respectively are estimated. The depth-migrated receiver function showed almost well resolved Moho for the two profiles. Although the limited quantity of data is used to short periods, the resolution and confidence level is not so bad. For the one profile that extended from the Aegean Sea coast to central Anatolia, we obtain Moho depths between 25 and 35. km. On the other profile along the western coast, the Moho depths range from 20 and 30. km. Shear wave speed was found to vary between 3.3. km/s and 3.7. km/s in the lower crust, and between 4.1. km/s and 4.4. km/s uppermost mantle.

We calculate receiver functions in the frequency domain using water-level deconvolution. The results are analysed using a combination of H-K stacking and depth stacking to determine robust Moho conversion depths and VP/Vs ratios across Anatolia. We detect a deep Moho in eastern Anatolia of up to $\sim$55 km, a generally normal Moho in Central Anatolia of $\sim$37-47 km and a thinned Moho in western Anatolia and Cyprus of $\sim$30 km. The VP/Vs ratio across the Anatolian Plate is generally slightly elevated; regions of extremely high VP/Vs ratio (>1.85) can be associated with recent volcanism in eastern and central Anatolia. High VP/Vs ratio measurements (>1.85) in western Anatolia may be indicative of partial melt in the lower crust associated with regional extension. {\textcopyright} The Authors 2013.

We have applied our method to data from 32 broadband seismograph stations that cover a 700 × 400 km2 region of the Grenville orogen, a 1.2-0.98 Ga Himalayan-scale collisional belt in eastern North America. Our seismograph network partly overlaps with Lithoprobe and other crustal refraction surveys. In 8 out of 9 cases where a crustal-refraction profile passes within 30 km of a seismograph station, the two independent crustal thickness estimates agree to within 7%. Our regional crustal-thickness model, constructed using both teleseismic and refraction observations, ranges between 34.0 and 52.4 km. Crustal-thickness trends show a strong correlation with geological belts, but do not correlate with surface topography and are far in excess of relief required to maintain local isostatic equilibrium. The thickest crust (52.4 ± 1.7 km) was found at a station located within the 1.1 Ga mid-continent (failed) rift. The Central Gneiss Belt, which contains rocks exhumed from deep levels of the crust, is characterized by VP/VS ranging from 1.78 to 1.85. In other parts of the Grenville orogen, VP/VS is found to be generally less than 1.80. The thinnest crust (34.5-37.0 km) occurs northeast of the 0.7 Ga Ottawa-Bonnechere graben and correlates with areas of high intraplate seismicity. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Coverage from 206 broadband seismic stations provides the first opportunity to resolve variations in crustal composition, thickness, and heterogeneity on scales of a few km in depth and tens of km laterally across the HLP region. We utilize both H - $\kappa$ stacking and a new Gaussian-weighted common conversion point stacking technique. We find crust that is 40 km thick beneath the Cascades, Idaho Batholith, and Owyhee Plateau and thinner (∼31 km) crust beneath the HLP and northern Great Basin. Low Poisson's ratios of ∼0.240 characterize the granitic crust beneath the Idaho Batholith, while the Owyhee Plateau exhibits values of ∼0.270, typical of average continental crust. The Owyhee Plateau is a thick simple crustal block with distinct edges at depth. The western HLP exhibits high average values of 0.304, typical for regions of widespread basaltic volcanism. Combined with other geological and geophysical observations, the areas of abnormally high Poisson's ratios (∼0.320) and low-velocity zones in the crust beneath north-central and southern Oregon are consistent with the presence of partial melt on either side of the HLP trend, suggesting a central zone where crustal melts have drained to the surface, perhaps enabled by the Brothers Fault Zone. Thicker crust and an anomalous N-S band of low Poisson's ratios (∼0.252) skirting the Steens Mountain escarpment is consistent with residuum from a midcrustal magma source of the massive flood basalts, supporting the view of extensive mafic underplating and intraplating of the crust from Cenozoic volcanism.

abstract = {Sp and Ps converted seismic waves at 93 permanent seismic stations are used to image upper mantle velocity discontinuities across the contiguous United States and portions of southeast Canada and northwest Mexico. Receiver functions are calculated with frequency-domain deconvolution and migrated with 1D models that account for variations in crustal structure and mantle velocities between stations. Strong positive Ps phases from the Moho are observed and agree well with previous crustal thickness estimates. In the tectonically active western U.S., high amplitude, negative Sp phases are interpreted as the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) at depths of 51-104 km. These phases indicate a large and rapid LAB velocity gradient and are consistent with an anomalously hot asthenosphere that is rich in water or contains partial melt. In the regions of the Phanerozoic southern and eastern U.S where Sp phases are interpretable as the LAB, the discontinuity lies at depths of 75-111 km and is also too sharp to be explained by temperature alone. In contrast, no Sp phases are observed at depths comparable to the base of the thick high velocity lithosphere that lies beneath cratonic North America and certain portions of the Phanerozoic eastern U.S. At these stations, negative Sp phases occur at depths of 59-113 km and are interpreted as the top of a low velocity zone internal to the lithosphere. The absence of an observable LAB discontinuity in regions of thick lithosphere indicates that the LAB velocity gradient is distributed over more than 50-70 km in depth and is consistent with a purely thermal boundary.

abstract = {Ps receiver functions were stacked to determine crustal thickness and Vp/Vs ratios for the 28 stations of the Florida-to-Edmonton Broadband Seismometer Array and 6 adjacent permanent stations. Roots of thickened crust exist beneath the Paleozoic Appalachian orogen and the Proterozoic Trans-Hudson orogen. The ratios of surface elevation to root thickness are lower than observed in young, active orogens, as are average crustal root buoyancies determined from gravity data. These results are consistent with global trends, and may be explained by increased crustal root density due to metamorphism. Crustal thickening is also observed beneath the Mid-Continent Rift in Iowa, consistent with compressional inversion of the rift during the Grenville orogeny.

abstract = {Receiver functions (RFs) from teleseismic events recorded by the NARS-Baja array were used to map crustal thickness in the continental margins of the Gulf of California, a newly forming ocean basin. Although the upper crust is known to have split apart simultaneously along the entire length of the Gulf, little is known about the behaviour of the lower crust in this region. The RFs show clear P-to-S wave conversions from the Moho beneath the stations. The delay times between the direct P and P-to-S waves indicate thinner crust closer to the Gulf along the entire Baja California peninsula. The thinner crust is associated with the eastern Peninsular Ranges batholith (PRB). Crustal thickness is uncorrelated with topography in the PRB and the Moho is not flat, suggesting mantle compensation by a weaker than normal mantle based on seismological evidence. The approximately W-E shallowing in Moho depths is significant with extremes in crustal thickness of ∼21 and 37 km. Similar results have been obtained at the northern end of the Gulf by Lewis et al., who proposed a mechanism of lower crustal flow associated with rifting in the Gulf Extensional Province for thinning of the crust. Based on the amount of pre-Pliocene extension possible in the continental margins, if the lower crust did thin in concert with the upper crust, it is possible that the crust was thinned during the early stages of rifting before the opening of the ocean basin. In this case, we suggest that when breakup occurred, the lower crust in the margins of the Gulf was still behaving ductilely. Alternatively, the lower crust may have thinned after the Gulf opened. The implications of these mechanisms are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Authors Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2007 RAS.},

abstract = {We compute receiver functions from teleseismic earthquake data recorded at the dense MERAMEX network in Central and East Java, Indonesia. In order to map the Moho depths H and the bulk crustal vP/vS-ratio $\kappa$ we apply the H-$\kappa$ stacking technique of Zhu and Kanamori (2000). Though the interpretation of the results is hampered by the high complexity of the recorded waveforms, in the context of a high noise level and of the heterogeneous assemblage of continental fragments and ophiolitic suture zones forming Southeast Asia, we were able to derive an average crustal thickness of about 34km. Support for the assumption of ophiolitic basement in the center of the island related to the Meratus suture zone comes from shallowing of the Moho to about 30km beneath the Kendeng zone. North and west of the Kendeng zone the Moho is imaged at anomalous depths down to 39km. The observed anomalies line up along the hypothetical boundary between the continental SW Borneo fragment and the Meratus suture and are indicative of crustal thickening caused by overthrusting and compressional deformation in the context of a former collision zone. Resulting vP/vS-ratios cannot be inferred reliably due to the complexity of the waveforms. Our results do not corroborate the hypothesis of a major structural change along the southern coast at the division between Central and East Java. Likewise, we do not find clear evidence for the existence of the postulated Muria-Progo lineament.},

abstract = {Receiver functions for numerous teleseismic earthquakes recorded at 23 broadband and mid-band stations in Saudi Arabia and Jordan were analyzed to map crustal thickness within and around the Arabian plate. We used spectral division as well as time domain deconvolution to compute the individual receiver functions and receiver function stacks. The receiver functions were then stacked using the slant stacking approach to estimate Moho depths and Vp/Vs for each station. The errors in the slant stacking were estimated using a bootstrap re-sampling technique. We also employed a grid search waveform modeling technique to estimate the crustal velocity structure for seven stations. A jackknife re-sampling approach was used to estimate errors in the grid search results for three stations. In addition to our results, we have also included published receiver function results from two temporary networks in the Arabian shield and Oman as well as three permanent GSN stations in the region. The average crustal thickness of the late Proterozoic Arabian s hield is 39 km. The crust thins to about 23 km along the Red Sea coast and to about 25 km along the margin of the Gulf of Aqaba. In the northern part of the Arabian platform, the crust varies from 33 to 37 km thick. However, the crust is thicker (41-53 km) in the southeastern part of the platform. There is a dramatic change in crustal thickness between the topographic escarpment of the Arabian shield and the shorelines of the Red Sea. We compared our results in the Arabian shield to nine other Proterozoic and Archean shields that include reasonably well-determined Moho depths, mostly based on receiver functions. The average crustal thickness for all shields is 39 km, while the average for Proterozoic shields is 40 km, and the average for Archean shields is 38 km. We found the crustal thickness of Proterozoic shields to vary between 33 and 44 km, while Archean shields vary between 32 and 47 km. Overall, we do not observe a significant difference between Proterozoic and Archean crustal thickness. We observed a dramatic change in crustal thickness along the Red Sea margin that occurs over a very short distance. We projected our results over a cross-section extending from the Red Sea ridge to the shield escarpment and contrasted it with a typical Atlantic margin. The transition from oceanic to continental crust of the Red Sea margin occurs over a distance of about 250 km, while the transition along a typical portion of the western Atlantic margin occurs at a distance of about 450 km. This important new observation highlights the abruptness of the breakup of Arabia. We argue that a preexisting zone of weakness coupled with anomalously hot upper mantle could have initiated and expedited the breakup. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The shear wave velocity structure beneath three southern African stations, Lusaka (LSZ), Lobatse (LBTB) and Boshof (BOSA) were estimated using the time domain inversion of stacked teleseismic receiver functions. Broadband teleseismic 3- component waveform data were used in a source equalisation procedure to estimate radial and transverse receiver functions for each station. The radial receiver functions were stacked according to the following criteria, an azimuthal interval of ±15°, similar ray parameter and shape. For the shield-based stations BOSA and LBTB simpler receiver functions than for LSZ, which is located in the Irumide belt, were obtained. The lateral variation in receiver functions with azimuth as observed at each station stems from lateral heterogeneities beneath each station. The velocity models were presented as P wave velocity models. From these models, the crust mantle transition zones beneath LSZ and BOSA were determined at depths of about 37-44 km and 34-38 km respectively. For LBTB, the northeast quadrant velocity model displayed a clear mantle-continent transition zone in the depth range 40-45 km, whilst the Moho depth in the southern quadrants is not as clear. Beneath all the stations, we observeda low velocity zone, which appears to correlate with the cratonic velocity structure. This feature is consistent with crustal structure results obtained in other cratonic or shield-based crustal studies. The results in this study contribute crustal structure information, which has been lacking at BOSA, LBTB and LSZ. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The Ethiopia Afar Geoscientific Lithospheric Experiment (EAGLE) was undertaken to provide a snapshot of lithospheric break-up above a mantle upwelling at the transition between continental and oceanic rifting. The focus of the project was the northern Main Ethiopian Rift (NMER) cutting across the uplifted Ethiopian plateau comprising the Eocene-Oligocene Afar flood basalt province. A major component of EAGLE was a controlled-source seismic survey involving one rift-axial and one cross-rift c. 400 km profile, and a c. 100 km diameter 2D array to provide a 3D subsurface image beneath the profiles' intersection. The resulting seismic data are interpreted in terms of a crustal and sub-Moho P-wave seismic velocity model. We identify four main results: (1) the velocity within the mid- and upper crust varies from 6.1 km s-1beneath the rift flanks to 6.6 km s-1beneath overlying Quaternary axial magmatic segments, interpreted in terms of the presence of cooled gabbroic bodies arranged en echelon along the axis of the rift; (2) the existence of a high-velocity body (Vp7.4 km s-1) in the lower crust beneath the northwestern rift flank, interpreted in terms of about 15 km-thick, mafic under-plated/intruded layer at the base of the crust (we suggest this was emplaced during the eruption of Oligocene flood basalts and modified by more recent mafic melt during rifting); (3) the variation in crustal thickness along the NMER axis from c. 40 km in the SW to c. 26 km in the NE beneath Afar. This variation is interpreted in terms of the transition from near-continental rifting in the south to a crust in the north that could be almost entirely composed of mantle-derived mafic melt; and (4) the presence of a possibly continuous mantle reflector at a depth of about 15-25 km below the base of the crust beneath both linear profiles. We suggest this results from a compositional or structural boundary, its depth apparently correlated with the amount of extension. {\textcopyright} The Geological Society of London 2006.},

abstract = {The westernmost Mediterranean mantle and lithosphere have evolved into their current configuration due to complex interactions between the African and Eurasian plates. To help unravel the regional tectonics, we use new broadband seismic data across the Gibraltar arc and into southern Morocco to infer azimuthal seismic anisotropy and flow patterns for the upper mantle based on shear wave splitting analysis. A deep (>600. km) earthquake in April 2010 was recorded by the array and allowed us to compare 31 direct S measurements with 235 teleseismic SK(K). S events from 3. years of deployment. The patterns of apparent fast polarization orientations and delay times suggest three major tectonic domains when interpreted jointly with recent tomographic images of the subducted slab: (1) a subducted slab related toroidal flow domain centered upon the Alboran Sea and southern Spain, leading to complex splits, (2), a region where the west African craton deflects mantle flow in the Anti-Atlas and High Plateaux, and, (3), an intermediate domain across the central High Atlas. Across the axis of the mountain belt a coherent, regional maximum of delay times is observed for both S and SKS splitting measurements, with polarizations predominantly parallel to the strike. We interpret this as possible SW-NE channeling of mantle flow beneath the region with a thinned lithosphere and slow seismic velocities beneath the central High Atlas Mountains. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {During the TopoIberia experiment, a total of 26 seismic broadband stations were recording in northern Morocco, providing for the first time extended regional coverage for investigating structure and seismotectonics of the southern branch of the Betic-Rif arc, its foreland, and the Atlas domain. Here, we analyze P-to-S converted waves in teleseismic receiver functions to infer gross crustal properties as thickness and Vp/Vs ratio. Strong lateral variations of the crustal thickness are observed throughout the region. Crustal thicknesses vary between 22 and 44 km and display a simple geographic pattern that divides the study area into three domains: entire northwestern Morocco underlain by a thickened crust with crustal thicknesses between 35 and 44 km; northeastern Morocco affected by significant crustal thinning, with crustal thicknesses ranging from 22 to 30 km, with the shallowest Moho along the Mediterranean coast; and an extended domain of 27-34 km thick crust, farther south which includes the Atlas domain and its foreland regions. Vp/Vs ratios show normal values of ∼1.75 for most stations except for the Atlas domain, where several stations give low V p/Vs ratios of around 1.71. The very sharp transition from thick crust in northwestern Morocco to thin crust in northeastern Morocco is attributed to regional geodynamics, possibly the realm of present-day subcrustal dynamics in the final stage of western Mediterranean subduction. Crustal thicknesses just slightly above 30 km in the southern domain are intriguing, showing that high topography in this region is not isostatically compensated at crustal level.

abstract = {A controlled source Near Vertical Reflection (NVR) Seismic experiment along a ∼100 km profile yields the first high quality seismic image of the crust and Moho across the southern Karoo Basin in South Africa. The highly reflective crust comprises upper, middle and lower layers. In the upper crust, folded and gently south-dipping continuous reflectors up to the Escarpment, represent the bedding of the Karoo and Cape Supergroups respectively. D{\'{e}}collement structures occur locally along carbonaceous shales of the Whitehill Formation. A well-defined mid-crustal layer that hosts the Beattie Magnetic Anomaly (BMA), occurs below a seismically imaged unconformity. The mid-crustal layer is ∼20 km thick in the vicinity of the BMA and is likely to be a subsurface continuation of the 1.0 to 2.0 Ga granitoid gneisses of the Bushmanland sub-province in the 1.2 to 1.0 Ga Namaqua-Natal Orogenic Belt. The internal seismic fabric of this layer is interpreted as a tectonic fabric dipping to the north. The probable source of the BMA appears at 7 to 15 km depth, as a narrow feature in a ∼10 km wide tectonically complex zone confined to the upper midcrust. The underlying lower crustal layer is wedge-shaped: ∼24 km thick in the north and decreasing to ∼12 km thick beneath the Cape Fold Belt. This lower crustal layer may represent granulite-gneisses of the Namaqua sub-province. The internal seismic fabric in the upper part of this layer dips both to the north and south, but a north-dipping fabric dominates the lower part. A clearly imaged undulating Moho occurs at a depth of ∼43 km in the north, with a nick point at ∼42 km depth, ∼35 km along the profile, and then deepens to ∼45 km in the south beneath the tectonic front of the Cape Fold Belt. A possible ∼1 to 2 km thick lowermost crustal layer of high seismic reflectivity, overlies the Moho and may represent underplated mafic material. The reflectivity seen in this NVR seismic image bears similarities to seismic transects across the coeval Mesoproterozoic Grenville orogen in Canada. {\textcopyright} 2007 September Geological Society of South Africa.},

abstract = {Two geophysical onshore-offshore lines on the southern margin of Africa form the Agulhas-Karoo Geophysical Transect (AKGT) and cross prominent geological features such as the Karoo Basin, Cape Fold Belt (CFB) and the Beattie Magnetic Anomaly (BMA). Geophysical data acquired along this AKGTransect between 2004 and 2007 within the Inkaba yeAfrica (IyA) framework, provide the platform for constructing a deep crustal section (IyA-200501) for the centre 100 km of the western AKGT-transect in order to resolve these features at depth. We present a detailed deep crustal model constructed from the joint interpretation of: i. archive data comprising surface geology, aeromagnetic data, nearby deep boreholes, teleseismic receiver functions and regional seismic reflection profiles, and ii. line coincident newly acquired high-resolution geophysical data consisting of near vertical seismic reflection data, shallow P- and S-wave velocity data, wide-angle refraction data, high resolution magnetotelluric data and impedance spectroscopy measurements on borehole samples. Our model differentiates four components in the up to 45 km thick crust: 1. a ∼2 to 5 km thick folded Karoo Supergroup, disrupted by low-angle thrust faults rooted in a zone of local decollements in the lower Ecca Group and resting paraconformably on 2. a continuous undeformed sub-horizontal ∼1.5 to 10 km thick wedge of the Cape Supergroup (CSG). This CSG wedge stretches from the Escarpment in the north to the tectonic front of the CFB in the south, and rests on an unconformity that dips about three degrees to the south. The angular unconformity is interpreted as an erosional peneplain that separates the CSG wedge from component 3. the ∼13 to 21 km mid-crust basement below. The mid-crust contains a distinct north-dipping seismic fabric, here interpreted as ∼1.4 to 1.0 Ga Mesoproterozoic Namaqua-Natal Metamorphic Belt (NNMB) crust. A south-dipping mid-crustal detachment, interpreted as a ductile thrust zone, separates the mid-crust from component 4. a highly reflective ∼10 to 24 km thick lower crust. The latter is interpreted as an older Palaeoproterozoic section of the NNMB (or even Archean cratonic basement), and bounded by a ∼2 to 5 km thick, highly reflective bottom layer below that lies subparallel to a clear Moho. This bottom layer is interpreted as a mafic underplate, metasomatic reaction zone, or lower-crust to mantle transition zone. Collectively the seismic reflection and wide-angle refraction data support an interpretation that the NNMB mid-crustal layer contains the BMA source, possibly connected to two zones of strong reflectivity: a ∼10 to 12 km wide northern zone and a ∼5 to 7 km wide southern zone, both about 5 km thick and 7 to 8 km below surface. We interpret the BMA source to be at least in part, a Namaqua-like massive to disseminated, deformed/metamorphosed stratiform sulphide-magnetite ore body with metasomatic overprint The seismic reflection and -refraction data support an interpretation that a Pan-African suture zone at the BMA is absent and that instead, the NNMB continues below the CFB tectonic front, probably up to the continental margin and the Agulhas Fracture Zone. The seismic reflection data also supports a thin-skinned tectonic thrust model for the evolution of the CFB without significant fore-deep stratigraphic thickening of the Karoo Basin strata. A compatible tectonic model implies a Palaeozoic collision orogen setting, coupled to a south verging subduction zone much farther south of the CFB. Similarly, the geophysical data support a south dipping subduction zone during the amalgamation of the NNMB in the Mesoproterozoic. Current reconstructions of the Rodinia supercontinent link the NNMB and the Grenville Province of North America across the Grenville-Kibaran orogen. Our seismic section tests this reconstruction through a direct comparison with seismic profiles on the opposite flank of the orogen. Although the once adjacent continental blocks are now 1000s of kilometres apart, the seismic images show a good correlation and support the reconstruction. {\textcopyright} 2011 December Geological Society of South Africa.},

abstract = {This study investigates crustal thickness and properties within the Libyan region. Results obtained from 15 seismic stations belonging to the Libyan Center for Remote Sensing and Space Science are reported, in addition to 3 seismic stations publically available, using receiver functions. The results show crustal thicknesses ranging from 24 km to 36 km (with uncertainties ranging between ±0.10 km and ±0.90 km). More specifically, crustal thickness ranges from 32 km to 36 km in the southern portion of the Libyan territory then becomes thinner, between 24 km and 30 km, in the coastal areas of Libya and thinnest, between 24 km and 28 km, in the Sirt Basin. The observed high Vp/Vs value of 1.91 at one station located at the AS Sawda Volcanic Province in central Libya indicates the presence of either partial melt or an abnormally warm area. This finding suggests that magma reservoirs beneath the Libyan territory may still be partially molten and active, thereby posing significant earthquake and volcanic risks. The hypothesis of an active magma source is further demonstrated though the presence of asthenospheric upwelling and extension of the Sirt Basin. This study provides a new calculation of unconsolidated sediment layers by using the arrival time of the P to S converted phases. The results show sediments thicknesses of 0.4 km to 3.7 km, with the Vp/Vs values ranging from 2.2 to 4.8. The variations in crustal thickness throughout the region are correlated with surface elevation and Bouguer gravity anomalies, which suggest that they are isostatically compensated.},

abstract = {Wide angle reflection and refraction seismic (WARRS) surveys at key sections of the Northern Red Sea and adjacent areas enabled a better definition of the crust and upper mantle structure. A fundamental asymmetry of the region was revealed by the results of profiles, which cover both flanks of the Red Sea main trough, the coastal plains and the bordering Precambrian shields. This asymmetry is clearly expressed by the presence of different crustal types on both flanks: the western flank shows oceanised crust within only 20 km off the African coast, while the whole eastern flank is underlain by a continental type of crust. Likewise, the shape of the continent-ocean transitions differs significantly on both flanks: the Arabian margin extends almost into the centre of the Red Sea and shows considerable stretching and attenuation of the continental crust, while the African margin, on the other hand, even thickens towards the escarpment and appears very abrupt. The influence of the Red Sea opening, as reflected by the decrease of seismic velocities and the increase of Poisson's ratio in the upper mantle due to partial melting, is strictly limited to the area seaward of the Egyptian escarpment. The asymmetry in the Northern Red Sea is regarded to be the expression of strike-slip processes in the initial stages of Red Sea evolution. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

abstract = {The crustal and uppermost-mantle structure of major units of the Afro-Arabian rift system has been consecutively investigated by seismic-refraction surveys in the Jordan-Dead Sea rift, the Red Sea, the Afar depression and the East African rift of Kenya. With the exception of the Jordan-Dead Sea transform, the entire Afro-Arabian rift system is underlain by anomalous mantle with Pn-velocities less than 8 km/s, while under the rift flanks the velocity is clearly equal to or above 8.0 km/s. Various styles of rifting have been found. Oceanic crust floors the axial trough of the southern Red Sea rift, thinned continental crust underlies the margins of the Red Sea as well as the Afar depression and the northern Kenya rift. On the other hand, 30-35-km-thick continental crust is found both under the Jordan-Dead Sea rift, where strike-slip rifting is active and thinning towards the Mediterranean occurs, and under the central Kenya rift, where updoming is apparently the controlling feature. While the transition from thinned continental to 5-6-km-thick oceanic crust in the centre of the Red Sea appears to be more gradual, the transition from rift-related structure to undisturbed continental crust of 40 ± 5 km thickness is mostly rather abrupt. The seismic data indicate various stages of rifting evidenced by different styles of crustal structure and they imply the presence of heated uppermost-mantle under most parts of the rift system, possibly related to plume activity. Local volcanism may disrupt and/or underplate the crust in places, altering in particular the structure of the lower crust. Progressive thickening of the rifted crust away from the oceanized centres in the southern Red Sea and Gulf of Aden towards north and south may be viewed as an evolutionary sequence which, however, may be difficult to explain when viewing the Afro-Arabian rift system as an active rift controlled by plume activity.},

abstract = {Dynamic processes at sheared margins associated with the formation of sedimentary basins and marginal ridges are poorly understood. The southern African margin provides an excellent opportunity to investigate the deep crustal structure of a transform margin and to characterize processes acting at these margins by studying the Agulhas-Falkland Fracture Zone, the Outeniqua Basin, and the Diaz Marginal Ridge. To do this, we present the results of the combined seismic land-sea experiments of the Agulhas-Karoo Geoscience Transect. Detailed velocity-depth models show crustal thicknesses varying from ̃42 km beneath the Cape Fold Belt to ̃28 km beneath the shelf. The Agulhas-Falkland Fracture Zone is embedded in a 50 km wide transitional zone between continental and oceanic crust. The oceanic crust farther south exhibits relatively low average crustal velocities (̃6.0 km/s), which can possibly be attributed to transform-ridge intersection processes and the thermal effects of the adjacent continental crust during its formation. Crustal stretching factors derived from the velocity-depth models imply that extension in the Outeniqua Basin acted on regional as well as more local scales. We highlight evidence for two episodes of crustal stretching. The first, with a stretching factor b of 1.6, is interpreted to have influenced the entire Outeniqua Basin. The stresses possibly originated from the beginning breakup between Africa and Antarctica (̃169-155 Ma). The second episode can be associated with a transtensional component of the shear motion along the Agulhas-Falkland Transform from ̃136 Ma. This episode caused additional crustal stretching with $\beta$ = 1.3 and is established to only have affected the southern parts of the basin. Crustal velocities directly beneath the Outeniqua Basin are consistent with the interpretation of Cape Supergroup rocks underlying most parts of the basin and the Diaz Marginal Ridge. We propose that the formation of this ridge can be either attributed to a transpressional episode along the Agulhas-Falkland Transform or, more likely, to thermal uplift accompanying the passage of a spreading ridge to the south. {\textcopyright} 2009 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {The KRISP flank line E converges with the Kenya rift at an angle of about 45° and is approximately parallel to the older Anza graben to the north. The depth to the basement is almost zero along the entire onshore part of the profile with higher velocities at the southeastern end indicative of extensive Precambrian gabbroic intrusions in the upper crust. The Moho shallows steadily from about 35 km at the southeastern end of the profile to about 24 km under Lake Turkana. Even though the Moho rises fairly steadily, there is significant heterogeneity in the crust above it. This shows that the extension is unevenly distributed between the upper and the lower crust. The Moho is laminated and variably reflective. Compared to the KRISP cross-line D further south, the crust is unexpectedly thin and shows extension increasing in a northerly direction. This extension is probably not associated with the Anza and Kenya rifting but with the profile's position on the slope of the Kenya dome. The indications are that there is a relatively abrupt change to a 20-km Moho depth near the Lake Turkana Central shotpoint. This change to a mid-rift crustal thickness occurs not at the postulated margin at the southeastern shore of Lake Turkana but at least 50 km further to the northwest. We suggest that the position of this margin may need to be redefined. The Pn velocity is quite high at 8.1 km/s. This may indicate either a cold upper mantle or anisotropy. An upper-mantle reflector has been identified between 15 and 20 km below the Moho. It dips gently away from the rift. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

The resulting crustal stretching factor is about 1.05–1.08 for the MRZ, which is approximately 10–40% lower than that observed in the mature segments of the East African Rift System (EARS). The low stretching factor is consistent with the general absence of volcanism in the MRZ, and the relatively high Vp/Vs (≥ 1.81) beneath the southern MRZ, when combined with observations from previous studies, indicate the possible existence of crustal partial melting, elevated temperatures or fluid-filled deep crustal faults that are likely associated with lithospheric stretching. In sharp contrast with the southern MRZ, low Vp/Vs measurements in the range of 1.69–1.72 are observed along the western boundary of the northern MRZ, which could be attributable to the infiltration of magma-derived CO2 into the crust. The LRZ shows negligible crustal thinning and a Vp/Vs that is comparable to the globally averaged value for continental crust, suggesting a complete post-rifting recovery of crustal properties in terms of crustal thickness and Vp/Vs.},

The eastern Zimbabwe and the southern Kaapvaal cratons are characterized by small H (∼38 km), small $\phi$ (∼1.73), and large R (∼0.15) values, suggesting that the relatively undisturbed Archean crust beneath southern Africa is separated from the mantle by a sharp Moho and is felsic in composition. The Limpopo belt, which was created by a collisional event at 2.7 Ga, displays large H (∼43 km) but similar $\phi$ and R values relative to the cratonic areas. The Bushveld Mafic Intrusion Complex and its surrounding areas show large $\phi$ (∼1.78), large H (∼43 km), and small R (∼0.11) values, reflecting the intrusion of mafic material into the original crust as a result of the Bushveld event at 2.05 Ga. Excluding the Bushveld, the spatially consistent and age-independent low $\phi$ accentuate the difference between felsic crustal composition and more mafic island arcs that are thought to be the likely source of continental material. Within such an island arc model, our data, combined with xenolith data excluding mantle delamination in cratonic environments, suggest that the modification to a felsic composition (e.g., by the partial melting of basalt and removal of residue by delamination) is restricted to have occurred during the collision between the arcs and the continent.

abstract = {Crustal structure in Kenya and Ethiopia has been investigated using receiver function analysis of broadband seismic data to determine the extent to which the Cenozoic rifting and magmatism has modified the thickness and composition of the Proterozoic crust in which the East African rift system developed. Data for this study come from broadband seismic experiments conducted in Ethiopia between 2000 and 2002 and in Kenya between 2001 and 2002. Two methods have been used to analyze the receiver functions, the H-k method, and direct stacks of the waveforms, yielding consistent results. Crustal thickness to the east of the Kenya rift varies between 39 and 42 km, and Poisson's ratios for the crust vary between 0.24 and 0.27. To the west of the Kenya rift, Moho depths vary between 37 and 38 km, and Poisson's ratios vary between 0.24 and 0.27. These findings support previous studies showing that crust away from the Kenya rift has not been modified extensively by Cenozoic rifting and magmatism. Beneath the Ethiopian Plateau on either side of the Main Ethiopian Rift, crustal thickness ranges from 33 to 44 km, and Poisson's ratios vary from 0.23 to 0.28. Within the Main Ethiopian Rift, Moho depths vary from 27 to 38 km, and Poisson's ratios range from 0.27 to 0.35. A crustal thickness of 25 km and a Poisson's ratio of 0.36 were obtained for a single station in the Afar Depression. These results indicate that the crust beneath the Ethiopian Plateau has not been modified significantly by the Cenozoic rifting and magmatism, even though up to a few kilometers of flood basalts have been added, and that the crust beneath the rifted regions in Ethiopia has been thinned in many places and extensively modified by the addition of mafic rock. The latter finding is consistent with models for rift evolution, suggesting that magmatic segments with the Main Ethiopian Rift, characterized by dike intrusion and Quaternary volcanism, act now as the locus of extension rather than the rift border faults.

abstract = {Existing models of the structure and evolution of the Kenya Rift such as pure shear lithospheric extension, extension by simple shear or rift development by diapiric upwelling of an asthenolith, were based upon surface geology and a few geophysical (mainly gravity and seismic) data sets. Since the knowledge of the lithospheric structure plays an important role to distinguish between these different models, the Kenya Rift International Seismic Project was conducted in 1990 in the area of the Kenya Rift. The project involved a detailed multi-fold refraction wide-angle reflection line in the northern Kenya Rift along the western shore of Lake Turkana which is the most prominent feature of the so-called Turkana depression. Under-water explosions were used as sources and a good signal-to-noise ratio was obtained allowing the identification of arrivals from the crust and upper mantle. The most important result of modelling the data is a crustal thickness of 21 km in the area of Lake Turkana, whereas in the area of the Kenya dome the crustal thickness is 34 km. This points to an extension not previously expected in the northern Kenya Rift. The Moho discontinuity appears as a transition zone in the northern part of the profile, whereas in the southern part it changes to a first-order discontinuity. The largest vertical and lateral heterogeneities are observed in the rift infill displaying basins of varying thickness. The upper and lower crust which are separated by the Conrad discontinuity (the velocity changes from 6.2 to 6.4 km/s here) show very little lateral heterogeneity. The P-wave velocity in the upper mantle was modelled to be 7.7 km/s and thus can be distinguished from that in the southern Kenya Rift, where a velocity of 7.5 km/s was observed. The crustal structure of the graben supports a model of a southerly propagation of the rift. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

abstract = {Continental rifting is constrained by the architecture and heterogeneous composition of lithosphere within which rifting occurs. Recent studies in Ethiopia show that the Cenozoic northern Main Ethiopian Rift (NMER) has developed in a Neoproterozoic lithospheric framework modified by a Tertiary plume, magma injection having replaced mechanical failure as the main strain accommodation mechanism. A 400 km long profile of 91 broadband seismic stations striking southeast across the NMER from the uplifted Ethiopian plateau to beyond the southern margin of the rift has provided a high-resolution P receiver function section, here interpreted in terms of crustal architecture and composition in light of independent geophysical observations. Synrift deposits are identified over a ∼10 km wide region beneath which strain was accommodated during the early stages of rifting. Major variations in crustal thickness and seismic properties along the profile divide the crust into four distinct regions. Beneath the northwestern rift flank (average crustal thickness 37.5 km and Vp/Vs 1.82) mafic middle and lower crustal rocks are overlain by a felsic upper crust. Here a high P wave velocity lowest crustal layer (northwestern lower crustal layer) is proposed to consist of frozen gabbroic sills and possibly some partial melt. We suggest partial melting of lower crustal rocks and/or fractional crystallization may have contributed to the bimodal prerift and synrift magmatism. Also, the presence of this layer through its effect on crustal and lithospheric strength and riftrelated diking may have controlled the location and development of the NMER in the vicinity of the profile. Beneath the rift (average crustal thickness 34.5 km and V p/Vs 1.87) the crust is subdivided into a northwestern sector, with a thinned crust and strong likelihood of partially molten rocks, and a southeastern sector, where high velocity and density anomalies and the presence of a Moho "hole" in the receiver function profile constrain the limits of a well-developed crustal magma system. To the southeast, a 35 km wide zone marks the transition from intruded and thinned (by ∼5 km) crust beneath the rift to the amagmatic, thick crust of the southeastern rift flank (average crustal thickness 39 km and Vp/Vs 1.77) suggested to be of felsic to intermediate composition.

The velocity model indicates that the Kenya rift at this location (near the Equator) is a relatively narrow (about 100 km wide) feature from surface expression (fault-bounded basins) to upper-mantle depths. A 5-km-deep, sediment- and volcanic-filled basin is present beneath the rift valley. Seismic velocities in the underlying crust are slightly higher directly beneath the rift valley than in the adjacent terranes.

abstract = {The closure of ancient oceans created a dynamic setting suitable for craton formation via the thickening of continental material over a mantle downwelling. This process subjected the thickening lithosphere to extensive deformation, forming internal structure that can be preserved over the lifetime of the craton. Recent seismic imaging of cratonic lithosphere has led to observations of anomalous features colloquially known as midlithospheric discontinuities. These discontinuities are attributed to a range of sources, including the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary, melt accumulation, and phase transitions. However, the internal structure imaged within these cratons might be reflective of their formation. In particular, the orientation and nature of the variable depths of the midlithospheric discontinuities suggest a more complicated origin such as that which could be introduced during the formation and thickening phase of cratonic lithosphere. Here, we present geodynamic models demonstrating the internal structures produced during the formation of cratonic lithosphere as well as new seismological observations of midlithospheric discontinuities in the West African craton, together with reassessment of midlithospheric discontinuities observed in the North American, South African, Fennoscandia, and Australian cratons. We suggest that the midlithospheric discontinuities observed in these cratons could be remnants of deformation structures produced during the formation of the cratons after ancient oceans closed. {\textcopyright} 2014 Geological Society of America.},

abstract = {During the Geophysical Measurements Across the Continental Margin of Namibia (MAMBA) experiments, offshore and onshore refraction and reflection seismic as well as magnetic data were collected. Together with the existing free-air gravity data, these were used to derive two crustal sections across the ocean-continent transition. The results show that the Early Cretaceous continental breakup and the separation of South Africa and South America were accompanied by excessive igneous activity offshore. Off Namibia we found a 150-200 km wide zone of igneous crust up to 25 km thick. The upper part of this zone consists of an extrusive section comprising three units of basaltic composition: two distinct wedges of seaward dipping reflectors (SDRs) separated by flat-lying volcanic flows. The inner wedge of SDRs can be modeled as the source of a long-wavelength magnetic anomaly that borders long parts of both South Atlantic margins (anomaly G). The crust underneath these extrusives is characterized by high-velocity and high-density material (average values 7 km s-1, 3 × 103 kg m-3). Free-air gravity anomalies along both sides of the high-density crust are interpreted as edge effects resulting from juxtaposition with normal oceanic and continental crust on either side. We define the abrupt landward termination of this zone as the continent-ocean boundary, and consequently, the crust seaward is interpreted as exclusively igneous material and not intruded continental crust. Extrapolation of the interpreted geophysical features along the southwest African margin suggests a fast prograding narrow rift zone and sharp lithospheric rupture leading to the formation of a margin-parallel magmatic belt south of the Walvis Ridge. The influence of the Tristan da Cunha mantle plume may explain the widening of this thick igneous crust near the Walvis Ridge. Copyright 2000 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {A total 1500 km of seismic reflection and wide-angle profiles were acquired off the southern Moroccan margin during the DAKHLA cruise, a joint project of Ifremer, the Universities of Brest, El Jadida and Lisbon and Total. The shots along two profiles parallel to the margin and two profiles perpendicular to the margin were also recorded by ocean bottom seismometers (OBS). The profiles perpendicular to the margin were additionally extended on land using 14 stations on the northern profile and 11 stations on the southern profile. Modelling of the reflection and wide-angle seismic data reveals a 10 km deep sedimentary basin including two high velocity carbonate layers. Lateral crustal thinning is observed from a 27 km thick crystalline continental crust to a 7 km thick oceanic crust occurring over less than 100 km. The crystalline continental crust can be divided into two distinct layers of 12 and 15 km thickness. The oceanic crust east of the magnetic anomaly M25 displays higher velocities in layer 3 than west of the magnetic anomaly. The change in seismic velocity suggests a possible link to changes in accretionary processes of the oceanic crust. Some regions show seismic velocities between 6.8 and 7.4 km/s which could be explained by slightly elevated mantle temperatures during accretion of the crust. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The nature of the lower crust across the southern African shield has been investigated by jointly inverting receiver functions and Rayleigh wave group velocities for 89 broadband seismic stations located in Botswana, South Africa and Zimbabwe. For large parts of both Archaean and Proterozoic terrains, the velocity models obtained from the inversions show shear wave velocities ≥4.0 km/s below ∼20-30 km depth, indicating a predominantly mafic lower crust. However, for much of the Kimberley terrain and adjacent parts of the Kheis Province and Witwatersrand terrain in South Africa, as well as for the western part of the Tokwe terrain in Zimbabwe, shear wave velocities of ≤3.9 km/s are found below ∼20-30 km depth, indicating an intermediate-to-felsic lower crust. The areas of intermediate-to-felsic lower crust in South Africa coincide with regions where Ventersdorp rocks have been preserved, suggesting that the more evolved composition of the lower crust may have resulted from crustal reworking and extension during the Ventersdorp tectonomagmatic event at c. 2.7 Ga.

Group velocities for 2-15. s periods were obtained from surface wave tomography using local and regional events, while group velocities for 20-60. s periods were taken from a published model. 1-D shear wave velocity models obtained for each station show the presence of thickened crust in the center of the Bushveld Complex and a region at the base of the crust where shear wave velocities exceed 4.0. km/s. The shear wave velocity models also suggest that velocities in some upper crustal layers may be as high as 3.7-3.8. km/s, consistent with the presence of mafic lithologies. These results favor a continuous-sheet model for the Bushveld Complex in which the outcropping mafic layers of the western and eastern limbs are continuous at depth beneath the center of the complex. However, detailed modeling of receiver functions at one station within the center of the complex indicates that the mafic layering may be locally disrupted due to thermal diapirism triggered by the emplacement of the Bushveld Complex or thermal and tectonic reactivation at a later time. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Estimates of crustal and lithospheric thickness beneath ten permanent seismic stations in southern, central, and eastern Africa have been obtained from modeling S-wave receiver functions (SRFs). For eight of the examined stations, the Moho depth estimates agree well with estimates from previous studies using P-wave receiver functions (PRFs). For two stations, TSUM and BGCA, previous PRF estimates are not available, and our results provide new constraints on the Moho depth, indicating crustal thicknesses of 35 and 40 km, respectively. SRFs from four stations, BOSA, SUR, FURI, and ATD, display clear S-to-P (Sp) conversions from the lithosphereasthenosphere boundary (LAB), corresponding to lithospheric thicknesses of 155, 140, 80, and 34 km, respectively. As expected, thicker lithosphere is observed beneath the Precambrian Kaapvaal Craton (station BOSA) and the Namaqua-Natal mobile belt (station SUR) and thinner lithosphere is observed beneath the edge of the Ethiopian rift (station FURI) and the Afar Depression (station ATD). The thinner lithosphere beneath the two latter stations is consistent with the transition from continental to oceanic rifting at the Afar triple junction. For the remaining stations, bootstrap error estimates indicate that the Sp conversion from the LAB cannot be well resolved, calling into question interpretations of lithospheric structure in previous SRF studies using data from these same stations. {\textcopyright} 2009 December Geological Society of South Africa.},

We mapped crustal thickness and bulk Vp/Vs ratio by the H-k analysis of receiver functions. In the Damara Belt, the crustal thickness is ∼35km with a Vp/Vs ratio of <1.75. The crust is ∼30km thick at the coast in the Kaoko Belt. Strong variations in crustal thickness and Vp/Vs ratios are found at the landfall of the Walvis Ridge. Here and at ∼150km northeast of the coast, the crustal thickness increases dramatically reaching 44km and the Vp/Vs ratios are extremely high (∼1.89). These anomalies are interpreted as magmatic underplating produced by the mantle plume during the breakup of Gondwana. The area affected by the plume is smaller than 300km in diameter, possibly ruling out the existence of a large plume head under the continent during the breakup.

abstract = {The Namaqualand Metamorphic Complex forms part of the Precambrian shield of southern Africa, and hosts several major base metal deposits. A long line seismic refraction experiment traversing the Complex was conducted in order to complement geological and geophysical studies of the structure and evolution of this region. It was found that the Namaqualand lower crust is comprised of a substantial proportion of intermediate velocity (6.2 to 6.9 km/s) rocks. These intermediate velocity rocks approach the surface near the midpoint of the profile. Moho was found to be at a depth of 42 km. No correlation was found between the seismic and electrical resistivity models of the crust. When the seismic velocity structure of the Middle Proterozoic Namaqualand Metamorphic Complex is compared with that of adjacent geological provinces, it is found to differ significantly from the Archaean Kaapvaal Province, but resemble the Late Proterozoic Damara Province. These differences might be attributed to variations in the principal mechanisms of crustal growth between Archaean and Proterozoic times. -from Authors},

abstract = {Variations in crustal and lithospheric thicknesses below the Kachchh rift (KR) zone have been investigated employing the joint inversion of P receiver functions (RF) and Rayleigh-wave and Love-wave group velocity dispersion (5-70 s) on the broadband waveforms of teleseismic events. Estimated crustal and lithospheric thicknesses at 15 broadband sites led to the delineation of an updoming of 4-7 km in the Moho and 6-12 km in the asthenosphere beneath the central KR relative to the surrounding unrifted regions. The Moho depths vary from 35 to 42 km and lithospheric thicknesses range from 62 to 78 km. The observed marked shear velocity reduction (2%-6%) at the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) over an area of 120 km × 80 km suggests the presence of patches of partial melt in the asthenosphere below the KR, evidencing the possible presence of imprints of the Deccan-Reunion mantle plume. The coincidence of the area of updoming of the Moho and asthenosphere, and the confined aftershock activity below the central KR implies that these patches could provide a high input of volatile CO 2 into the lower crust, which might play a key role in generating the continued aftershock activity in the region since the occurrence of the 2001 M w 7.7 Bhuj mainshock.},

The derived crustal thickness of 10-25. km in the oceanic region increases to 34-35. km along the coast. A crustal thickness of 34-38. km is obtained beneath the Eastern Dharwar Craton and 36-45. km beneath the Western Dharwar Craton and the Southern Granulite Terrain. Sri Lanka has a thinner crust of 30-35. km.

An overview of crustal composition of the high-grade terrains of Gondwana land reveals that Poisson's ratios mostly lie in the range of 0.24-0.26. These lower than global average values from both Archean and Proterozoic shields, including the metamorphic regions appear to be characteristic of Precambrian shields consistent with the average continental crust composition estimates showing 59% silica content. The two principal mantle discontinuities beneath PALK are found at 418 and 678 km, respectively, which are both deeper than the global averages, suggesting a hotter upper mantle. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Teleseismic data recorded at the broadband seismological observatory of the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur are analyzed to determine the seismic characteristics of the crust beneath the western Bengal basin. Receiver functions calculated from the teleseismic P waveform for a range of back azimuths show little variation in the Moho Ps arrival time, indicating a nearly one-dimensional crustal structure beneath Kharagpur. Transforming the time domain receiver functions into the H-Vp/Vs domain for a stack of all receiver functions reveals a 38 ± 2 km thick crust with a Vp/Vs of 1.73 ± 0:01. Receiver functions stacked in narrow bins of back azimuth and great-circle-arc distance were inverted jointly with group velocity dispersion data for periods from 15 to 45 sec. Joint inversion results reveal a near surface sedimentary layer of ∼1.5 km thickness, a 13 km thick upper crust, and a 23 km thick lower crust with the Moho at a depth of ∼37.5 km. The average crustal S-wave velocity is 3.7 km/sec. The top 0.5 km of the sedimentary layer has very low S-wave velocity and a large impedance contrast with the underlying layer. This represents the thin layer of unconsolidated sediments and weathered laterites near the surface as seen from deep seismic sounding (DSS) studies across the region. The S-wave velocity structure of the crust beneath Kharagpur is the first such result for the western Bengal basin and is broadly similar to that of the Indian Shield crust. A comparison of the crustal thickness and lower crustal velocities between Kharagpur and Agartala, seperated by the Eocene hinge zone, shows remarkable differences. Crustal models beneath Agartala reveal ∼36 km thick crust with the presence of a high-velocity lower crust (∼6 km thick), possibly oceanic in nature, which is absent beneath Kharagpur. The hinge zone, therefore, separates the continental crust of the western Bengal basin from the eastern deep basinal oceanic crust, both bein overlain by sediments derived from the Himalayas.},

South India could be broadly divided into regions with thin crust (32-38 km) and thick crust (38-54 km). Thin crust domains include the East Dharwar Craton (EDC), Cuddapah basin and Madurai/Kerala Khondalite Block. The thicker crust domain includes the Western Dharwar Craton (WDC) and northern part of Southern Granulite Terrain. The WDC shows progressive increase in thickness from 38 km in north to 46-54 km in south, compared to an almost flat Moho beneath the EDC. Compositionally, most of the crustal domains are felsic to intermediate (Vp/Vs $\sim$ 1.69-1.75) except the mid Archean block in the southern WDC where it is mafic (Vp/Vs > 1.81). Considering erosion depth in the WDC, we argue for Himalaya like $\sim$70 km thick crust beneath it during the Archean. Variation in crustal thickness does not have a first-order influence on regional topography in South India and suggests significant role for the crustal composition. We also present evidence of mid-lithospheric low velocity at $\sim$85-100 km beneath South India. {\textcopyright} Indian Academy of Sciences.},

In addition, the crust beneath the NSL has higher Vp/Vs of 1.84 compared to ∼1.73 in the surrounding, suggestive of a high-density mafic mass at depth that compensates the crustal root, also supported by small topographic variation (200 m) across the lineament.

We operated seven broadband seismographs on the shield along a N-S corridor from Nanded (NND) to Bangalore (BGL) and used data from these to determine the seismic characteristics of this part of the shield. Surface wave dispersion and receiver function data from these sites and the Geoscope station at Hyderabad (HYB) give the shear wave velocity structure of the crust along this 600 km long transect. Inversion of Rayleigh wave phase velocity measured along the profile shows that the crust has an average thickness of 35 km and consists of a 3.66 km s-1, 12 km thick layer overlying a 3.81 km s-1, 23 km thick lower crust. At all sites, the receiver functions are extremely simple, indicating that the crust beneath each site is also simple with no significant intracrustal discontinuities. Joint inversion of the receiver function and surface wave phase velocity data shows the seismic characteristics of this part of the Dharwar crust to be remarkably uniform throughout and that it varies within fairly narrow bounds: crustal thickness (35 ± 2 km), average shear wave speed (3.79 ± 0.09 km s-1), and Vp/Vs ratio (1.746 ± 0.014). There is no evidence for a high velocity basal layer in the receiver function crustal images of the central Dharwar craton, suggesting that there is no seismically distinct layer of mafic cumulates overlying the Moho and implying that the base of the Dharwar crust has remained fairly refractory since its cratonization.},

Receiver functions and surface wave data from stations located in East Antarctica, Sri Lanka, the southern-Indian high-grade terranes, Madagascar and the Tanzania-Mozambique belt, were used to determine the shear-wave velocity structure, Moho depth and VP/VS values of the respective crustal segments. This study provides an additional dimension to the otherwise well-documented characteristic petrology of their surface exposures and other geological signatures such as their extensive granulitization and gem formation during the Pan-African event. Analysis of the receiver functions and surface wave data for these seismic stations located on their present day widely distributed continental fragments have been made. It is observed that with the exception of KOD (at Kodaikanal hill), situated on the southern Indian granulites having the thickest crust (∼43.5 km), most of the Pan-African granulitic terranes have a crustal thicknesses of ∼37 ± 0.8 km, with a transition to higher velocity at mid-crustal depths, and that their bulk composition is felsic. Average crustal VP/VS values (1.704 ± 0.03) and thicknesses (37.8 ± 0.8 km), for four stations (SYO, PALK, TRV and ABPO), now located in East Antarctica, Sri Lanka, India and Madagascar, respectively, show remarkable similarity, indicating that the Pan-African orogeny was extensive enough to reorder the crustal structure of a wide region with a broadly similar stamp. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Author compilation {\textcopyright} 2008 RAS.},

The average crustal Vs beneath the EDC is ∼3.70-3.78 km s-1 as compared to 3.80-3.95 km s-1 beneath the WDC. We observe significant lateral variation in the thickness of lower crust (Vs ∼ 3.8-4.2 km s-1): ∼10-15 km in the EDC compared to ∼20-30 km in the WDC. The lowermost part of the crust (Vs ≥ 4.0 km s-1) is thin (<5 km) beneath the EDC in contrast to more thickness (10-27 km) beneath the WDC. Our analysis suggests intermediate composition for the crust beneath the EDC similar to those for other cratons. In contrast, the mid-Archean exposed WDC crust has more mafic composition and exceptional thickness-a scenario at variance with the global observations. We interpret this thick mafic crust to represent undeformed geological segment of 3.36 Ga. The EDC with a nearly flat Moho, felsic to intermediate composition of crust and thin basal layer may represent a reworked terrain during the late-Archean. {\textcopyright} The Authors 2014.

abstract = {We report an anomalous present day crustal thickness of 43-52 km beneath the 3.4-3.0 Ga mid-Archean segment of the western Dharwar craton (WDC) undisturbed by Proterozoic events. In contrast, adjoining late-Archean (2.7-2.5 Ga) eastern Dharwar craton (EDC) has a 33-40 km crustal thickness similar to the Archean global average. Considering that mineral assemblages in the central part of the WDC crust (amphibolite grade metamorphics) equilibrated at a depth of 15-20 km, we argue that the western Dharwar crust 3.0 Ga ago must have been at least 60-80 km thick. Both segments of Dharwar craton crust exhibit Poisson's ratio of 0.24-0.28 suggesting felsic to intermediate average crustal composition. The thickest crust beneath WDC has also underlying high-velocity thicker lithosphere compared to EDC, inferred from faster arrivals of teleseismic P and S wave. The contact between WDC and EDC is marked as gradational thinning of crust (42-36 km) from Chitradurga thrust to the western part of Closepet granite. In WDC, the crustal thickness increases in step fashion towards the oldest crustal block. These details suggest terrain accretion in Dharwar craton during 3.4 to 2.5 Ga through subduction related process.},

abstract = {Analysis of data from nine, temporary broadband seismic stations operated across West Bengal and Sikkim, along with publicly available data from seismographs in the surrounding region, provides the first image of the descending Indian Plate beneath the Darjeeling-Sikkim Himalaya. The down-going Indian crust is imaged by receiver function common conversion point stacking using data from 32 sites in combination with more detailed analyses from simultaneous modelling of receiver function data and Rayleigh wave group velocity dispersion at 13 stations. Compared to locations farther south on the Indian Shield our southernmost station shows evidence for thickened crust beneath the Mahanadi Rift basin with a possible mafic basal layer. North of the Mahanadi Rift the Indian Moho is $\sim$38 km deep below the Archean terranes of the northeast part of the Indian Shield. The Moho then dips gently northward beneath the Himalayan foreland basin reaching a depth of 44-48 km below the Himalayan foothills. Below Sikkim the Moho continues to deepen but there are indications of secondary structures in the receiver function image and modelling results suggesting some imbrication of the crust as it flexes downward. The crust thickens further beneath the Greater Himalaya and southern Tibet reaching depths of $\sim$65-70 km below the Southern Tibet Detachment (STD). Below the Lhasa Terrane north of the STD a double discontinuity exists with interfaces at 55-60 km and $\sim$80 km depth. There is a significant reduction in the average shear wave velocity of the crystalline crust between sites to the south of and on the Himalayan foreland basin and sites in the Himalaya and to the north. Below the Himalaya and southern Tibet the P-to-S conversion (Ps) has a lower amplitude compared to that observed at sites on the undeformed Indian Shield. This decrease in amplitude of the Moho Ps phase could arise from a lower impedance contrast across the crust-mantle boundary or from scattering due to deformation of the crust and Moho. A coherent negative arrival beneath the Darjeeling-Sikkim Himalaya indicate the presence of a low velocity zone (LVZ), possibly associated with the Main Himalayan Thrust. This LVZ can be traced beneath the Darjeeling-Sikkim Himalaya but disappears beneath the Greater Himalaya. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors Geophysical Journal International {\textcopyright} 2010 RAS.},

Archean terrains (Eastern Dharwar, Bastar, Bundelkhand and Aravalli cratons) are underlain by crust with felsic-intermediate composition (Vinfp/inf/Vinfs/inf ∼ 1.65-1.75) in contrast to mafic composition (Vinfp/inf/Vinfs/inf 1.78) of crust beneath Vindhyan basin, Godavari basin, and the Narmada-Son Lineament (NSL) of Proterozoic age. The Moho depth varies between 33 and 43 km with no definite relationship with age of the crust. Duplex Moho with highly mafic underplated lower crust is characteristic feature of the NSL, signifying its paleo-rift character. Present day felsic character of the Indian Archean crust could be a consequence of post-formation modification of the initial mafic lower crust through the process of lithospheric delamination. This major tectonic event also created layered lithosphere beneath parts of India imprinted as positive velocity contrast at a depth of ∼80 km, usually referred to as Hales discontinuity. The upper part of the lithosphere has shear velocity (Vinfs/inf) ∼4.52 km/s and the lower one ∼4.77 km/s. We speculate that such a layered lithosphere could be due to a low-density, depleted spinel peridotite (with Archean affinity) lying over higher density fertile garnet peridotite of Proterozoic age. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A three-component broadband seismograph is in operation since January 2007 at the Indian School of Mines (ISM) campus, Dhanbad. We have used the broadband (BB) seismograms of 17 teleseismic events (M ≥ 5.8) recorded by this single BB station during 2008-09 to estimate the crust and upper mantle discontinuities in Dhanbad area which falls in the peninsular India shield. The converted wave technique and the Receiver function analysis are used. A 1-D velocity model has been derived using inversion. The Mohorovicic (Moho) discontinuity (crustal thickness) below the ISM observatory is estimated to be ∼41 km, with an average Poisson ratio of ∼0.28, suggesting that the crust below the Dhanbad area is intermediate to mafic in nature. The single station BB data shed new light to the estimate of crustal thickness beneath the eastern India shield area, which was hitherto elusive. Further, it is observed that the global upper mantle discontinuity at 410 km is delayed by ∼0.6 sec compared to the IASP-91 global model; this may be explained by a slower/hotter upper mantle; while the 660 km discontinuity is within the noise level of data. {\textcopyright} 2011 Geological Society of India.},

abstract = {The S wave velocity structure of the crust and uppermost mantle of the Indian shield has been investigated by jointly inverting P wave receiver functions and Rayleigh wave group velocities at 38 broadband stations in the subcontinent. The Indian shield is an amalgamation of several terranes of Archean and Proterozoic age that were partly flooded by Deccan Trap volcanism during Cenozoic times and that make up a natural laboratory for assessing models of Precambrian crustal evolution. Our results reveal significant variations in crustal thickness and deep crustal velocities: 45-50 km thick under the Archean West Dharwar craton and Southern Granulite Terrane, with lower crustal velocities around 4.1 km/s; 32-35 km thick beneath the Archean East Dharwar and Bundelkhand cratons, with lower crustal velocities around 3.8-3.9 km/s; 50-65 km thick under the Proterozoic Bhandara craton, with lower crustal velocities around 4.2-4.3 km/s; and ∼55 km thick under the Proterozoic Aravalli-Delhi belt, with lower crustal velocities around 4.2 km/s. S velocities in the 4.1-4.3 km/s range in the deep crust can be attributed to mafic lithologies, suggesting there has been no secular change in the Precambrian evolution of the south Indian shield. Moreover, pervasive mafic dike swarming throughout the Indian shield suggests that the layer of mafic cumulates is 2.5-1.6 Ga old and that it delaminated from some Archean terranes. Our interpretation is that mafic underplating of the terranes making up the Indian shield occurred in Proterozoic times and that a refractory root developed under the Archean terranes after the Proterozoic event.

abstract = {We have analysed receiver functions to derive simple models for crustal structure below 12 broad-band seismological stations from the MIDSEA project and 5 permanent broad-band stations in the Mediterranean region including northern Africa. To determine an accurate Moho depth we have reduced the trade-off between crustal velocities and discontinuity depth using a new grid search method, which is an extension of recently published methods to determine crustal thickness. In this method the best fitting synthetic receiver function, containing both the direct conversion and the reverberated phases, is identified on a model grid of varying Moho depth and varying Poisson's ratio. The values we found for Moho depth range from around 20 km for intra-oceanic islands and extended continental margins to near 45 km in regions where the Eurasian and African continents have collided. More detailed waveform modelling shows that all receiver functions can be well fit using a 2- or 3-layer model containing a sedimentary layer and/or a mid-crustal discontinuity. On comparing our results with Moho maps inferred from interpolated reflection and refraction data, we find that for some regions the agreement between our receiver function analysis and existing Moho maps is very good, while for other regions our observations deviate from the interpolated map values and extend beyond the geographic bounds of these maps.},

Here we study crustal structure beneath the CVL and adjacent regions in Cameroon using 1-D shear wave velocity models obtained from the joint inversion of Rayleigh wave group velocities and P-receiver functions for 32 broad-band seismic stations deployed between 2005 January and 2007 February. We find that (1) crustal thickness (35-39 km) and velocity structure is similar beneath the CVL and the Pan African Oubanguides Belt to the south of the CVL, (2) crust is thicker (43-48 km) under the northern margin of the Congo Craton and is characterized by shear wave velocities ≥4.0 km s-1 in its lower part and (3) crust is thinner (26-31 km) under the Garoua rift and the coastal plain. In addition, a fast velocity layer (Vs of 3.6-3.8 km s-1) in the upper crust is found beneath many of the seismic stations. Crustal structure beneath the CVL and the Oubanguides Belt is very similar to Pan African crustal structure in the Mozambique Belt, and therefore it appears not to have been modified significantly by the magmatic activity associated with the CVL. The crust beneath the coastal plain was probably thinned during the opening of the southern Atlantic Ocean, while the crust beneath the Garoua rift was likely thinned during the formation of the Benue Trough in the early Cretaceous. We suggest that the thickened crust and the thick mafic lower crustal layer beneath the northern margin of the Congo Craton may be relict features from a continent-continent collision along this margin during the formation of Gondwana. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors Geophysical Journal International {\textcopyright} 2010 RAS.},

We find for both Archean and Proterozoic terranes a similar range of crustal thicknesses ($\sim$. 33-45. km), similar mean crustal shear wave velocities ($\sim$. 3.6-3.7. km/s), and similar amounts of heterogeneity in lower crustal structure, as reflected in the thickness of lowermost crust with shear wave velocities ≥. 4.0. km/s. There is little evidence for secular variation in crustal structure, indicating that there may have been few changes over much of Earth's history in the processes that form the continental crust.

abstract = {A 145 km N-S seismic traverse was deployed to determine the crustal structure of the Limpopo mobile belt in southern Zimbabwe and the nature of its northern boundary with the Zimbabwean craton. Rockbursts from South African gold mines to the south and regional seismicity from the Kariba-South Zambia belt to the north were used as seismic sources. P-wave relative teleseismic residuals were also measured to assess whether any velocity contrast between the craton and the mobile belt extended into the upper mantle. Interpretation of reduced travel times from the local Buchwa iron-ore mine blasts, which were broadside to the traverse, revealed an upper crustal interface in the Limpopo mobile belt at a depth of 5.8 ± 0.6 km, dividing material with a velocity of about 5.8 km/s from that of about 6.4 km/s. On the craton, arrivals from the same source showed a 4.4 ± 0.5 km thick 5.5 km/s layer overlying crust of about velocity 6.5 km/s. P-wave arrivals from the regional seismicity were used to construct a crustal cross-section. Absolute crustal thickness was tentatively estimated from the identification of a Moho reflection on the mine blast recordings. To the south of Rutenga, the crust thins from around 34 km to 29 km in association with a positive gravity anomaly centred over the late-Karoo Nuanetsi Igneous Province and Karoo Tuli Syncline. North of Rutenga to the boundary with the Zimbabwean craton, the crust is about 34 km thick. The craton boundary was found to be a steeply southerly dipping zone associated with high-velocity material, which could either be deep-seated greenstones or mafic material associated with the margin in the region studied. This zone divides cratonic crust, which was found to be about 40 km thick, from that typical of the mobile belt and implies a step in the Moho of around 6 km. Analysis of relative teleseismic residuals showed that the velocity contrasts are not confined to the crust but extend into the uppermost upper mantle with the cratonic lithosphere being about 4% faster than that of the Limpopo mobile belt. The resolution of the technique is such that it is difficult to ascertain whether these differences are features of Precambrian evolution or are due to reactivation of the upper mantle during Karoo igneous and tectonic activity. {\textcopyright} 1987.},

We have deployed a temporary seismic network on the Ugandan side of the mountain range to study the seismic velocity structure of the crust and upper mantle beneath this section of the rift. We present results from a receiver-function study revealing a simple crustal structure along the eastern rift flank with a more or less uniform crustal thickness of about 30 km. The complexity of inner-crustal structures increases drastically within the Rwenzori block. We apply different inversion techniques to obtain reliable results for the thickness of the crust. The observations expose a significantly thinner crust beneath the Rwenzori range with thickness values ranging from about 20-28 km beneath northern and central parts of the mountains. Our study therefore indicates the absence of a crustal root beneath the Rwenzori block. Beneath the Lake Edward and Lake George basins we detect the top of a layer of significantly reduced S-wave velocity at 15 km depth. This low-velocity layer may be attributed to the presence of partial melt beneath a region of recent volcanic activity. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

The aftershocks sequence recorded by 22 seismograph stations of Gujarat Seismic Network (GSNet) during the period from 2006 to 2009, encompassing approximately 80 km × 70 km rupture area had revealed clustering of aftershocks at depth of 5-35 km, which is seismogenic layer responsible for the occurrence of continued aftershocks activity in the study region. The 3D b-value mapping estimated from a total of 3850 precisely located aftershocks with magnitude of completeness M c≥ 2.7 shows that a high b-value region is sandwiched within the main shock hypocenter at the depth of 20-25. km and low b-value region above and below of the 2001 Bhuj main shock hypocenter. Estimates of 3-D seismic velocity (Vp; Vs) and Poisson's ratio (b{cyrillic}) structure beneath the region demonstrated a very close correspondence with the b-value mapping that supports the similar physicochemical processes of retaining fluids within the fractured rock matrix beneath the 2001 Bhuj mainshock hypocenter. The overall b-value is estimated close to 1.0 which reveals that seismogenesis is related to crustal heterogeneity, which, in turn also supported by low-Vs and high-b{cyrillic} structures. The high b-value and high-b{cyrillic} anomaly at the depth of 20-25. km indicate the presence of highly fractured heterogeneous rock matrix with fluid intrusions into it at deeper depth beneath the main shock hypocenter region. Low b-value and high-Vp in the region is observed towards the north-east and north-west of the main shock that might be an indication of the existence of relatively competent rock masses with negligible volume of cracks that may have contained over-pressurized fluids without molten rocks. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Despite their high elevation, studies indicate a lack of a deep crustal root (<40 km) while the lithosphere underneath is thinned (<100 km). Previous explanations for this thinning include asthenospheric upwelling due to small-scale convection or a small plume. We use data recorded at stations in SW Morocco to analyse teleseismic P-and S-wave receiver functions. Our study yields a crustal thickness ranging from 24 km near the Atlantic coast to 44 km beneath the High Atlas with an average crustal Vp/Vs ratio of 1.77 in the entire region. A crustal thickness of 40 km cannot entirely support the topography in this region. Furthermore, we find the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary at ̃80 km depth. The lithosphere beneath SW Morocco is thinner than beneath northern Morocco (>150 km). This lithospheric thinning supports the theory of thermal compensation of the mountain ranges. The mantle transition zone thickness amounts to 240 ± 10 km. The transition zone seems to be slightly thinned which might indicate a higher mantle temperature in this region. {\textcopyright} The Authors 2014.

abstract = {A number of geophysical onshore and offshore experiments were carried out along a profile across the southern margin of the African Plate in the framework of the Inkaba yeAfrica project. Refraction seismic experiments show that Moho depth decreases rapidly from over 40 km inland to around 30 km at the present coast before gently thinning out toward the Agulhas-Falkland Fracture Zone, which marks the transition zone between the continental and oceanic crust. In the region of the abruptly decreasing Moho depth, in the vicinity of the boundary between the Namaqua-Natal Mobile Belt and the Cape Fold Belt, lower crustal P-wave velocities up to 7.4 km/s are observed. This is interpreted as metabasic lithologies of Precambrian age in the Namaqua-Natal Mobile Belt, or mafic intrusions added to the base of the crust by younger magmatism. The velocity model for the upper crust has excellent resolution and is consistent with the known geological record. A joint interpretation of the velocity model with an electrical conductivity model, obtained from magnetotelluric studies, makes it possible to correlate a high-velocity anomaly north of the center of the Beattie magnetic anomaly with a highly resistive body.

abstract = {Teleseismic data from six broad-band stations on the south Indian shield have been analysed, primarily to examine the differences in the crustal structure between the eastern and western units of the Archaean Dharwar craton. SV receiver functions for these stations have been computed and modelled down to the Moho level in terms of Poisson's ratio and shear wave velocities. Results show that the crust for the entire Dharwar craton is mainly simple, and has a low (about 0.25) Poisson ratio. It is usually thinner and less complex than the adjacent Proterozoic crust. However, the western Dharwar craton crust (thickness ∼41 km) with a gradational Moho boundary, is substantially (>7 km) thicker than its eastern counterpart (thickness ∼34 km). No substantial differences in average crustal S velocities (3.6-3.8 km s-1) were found. The eastern Dharwar crust below the Proterozoic Cuddapah basin was also found to have remained relatively simple and undisturbed. The continental margin to the west of the Dharwar craton appears to have shifted further west off the coast, where a possible west coast fault has down-thrown a continental crustal block under the seas. The crust constituting the Deccan volcanic province in the western Indian shield is found to be similar to that of the eastern Dharwar craton. The crust underneath the neighbouring Godavari graben is significantly different from the Dharwar crust and resembles that of a typical rift-valley.},

abstract = {Over 800 receiver functions (RFs) from three broadband and five short period stations deployed in the northern segment of the Western Ghats of India, were analysed to examine the crustal constraints on the rift flank uplift mechanism of the Ghats. Estimates of Moho depths, mean shear velocities and Poisson's ratios were determined and used as constraints to model the RFs. The study reveals that the crust beneath the Ghats varies in thickness between 31 and 39 km and is neither uniformly thin nor thick as required by existing hypotheses for uplift mechanism. The Poisson's ratio is 0.26 and the mean shear velocity is 3.65 km s-1. The uncertainties in the estimates of the Moho depths and Poisson's ratios are ±2 km and ±0.01, respectively. The crust beneath the Ghats is 3-4 km thinner than that beneath the adjoining low-lying coastal plains suggesting block tectonics. Modelling the RFs using crustal constraints reveals sub-Moho low-velocity zones (LVZs) with velocity reductions of 0.5-0.65 km s-1 which are confined to shallow depths of about 50 km beneath the Ghats. The persistent relief of the Ghats may be attributed to the buoyancy forces of the possibly rift related shallow upper mantle LVZs beneath the Ghats. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Authors Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2006 RAS.},

abstract = {We present new results on structure, thickness, and composition of the crust in southern Africa based on 6300 seismic receiver functions at 85 stations. Application of Hk-stacking to the entire SASE dataset and use of multi-frequency bands improve resolution substantially. We observe a highly heterogeneous crustal structure with short wavelength variations in thickness (H), Vp/Vs-ratio (composition), and Moho sharpness, which defines $\sim$. 20 blocks that do not everywhere coincide with surface tectonic features. In the Zimbabwe Craton, the Tokwe block has H. = 35-38. km and Vp/Vs. = 1.74-1.79 whereas the thicker crust in the Tati block (H. = 47-51. km) may be related to deformation of the Archean crust along the cratonic margin. Two distinct crustal blocks with similar crustal thickness (42-46. km) but significantly different Vp/Vs-ratios are recognized in the Limpopo Belt. Extreme values of 1.90-1.94 at the dyke swarms in eastern Limpopo, and 1.84 at the Olifants River Dyke Swarm and easternmost Bushveld Intrusion Complex (BIC) indicate voluminous magmatic intrusions in the whole crust. We find no evidence for magmatic intrusions in the central (inferred) part of BIC, where the crust is thick (45-50. km) and Vp/Vs is low (1.68-1.70). This thick crustal root may have deflected rising magmas to form the two BIC lobes. Most of central Kaapvaal has thin (35-40. km) crust and Vp/Vs. $\sim$. 1.74. These characteristics are similar to the Tokwe block in Zimbabwe Craton and may indicate delamination of pre-existing lower crust, which is further supported by a very sharp Moho transition. The exposed cross-section in the Vredefort impact crater is non-representative of cratonic crust due to shallow Moho (34. km) and high Vp/Vs. $\sim$. 1.80 attributed to shock metamorphism. High Vp/Vs. = 1.76 is typical of the Witwatersrand Basin, and anomalously low Vp/Vs. = 1.66-1.67 marks the Kaapvaal-Kheis-Namaqua transition. Highly heterogeneous crust, both in thickness and Vp/Vs-ratio is typical of the Namaqua-Natal and Cape Fold Belts. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Deep Seismic reflection data from the Kalahari of western Botswana has been interpreted in terms of the tectonics of southern Africa. The 600 km of 12 fold data exhibit good quality reflections in the range 5-15 s TWT. The data outline the Nosop Basin, a depositional centre with greater than 10 km of Palaeozoic and younger sediments. Five prominent reflecting horizons are traced in the basement underlying the sediments. On the basis of the Seismic data, the Nosop is now interpreted as a single basin. The previous multi-basin interpretation of the aeromagnetic data -esults from features within the magnetic basement. The uppermost two basement units are interpreted as Proterozoic sediments that rest on Archean crust. The Seismic data show that the crust appears to thicken to the southeast as the Kaapvaal Craton is approached. At the same time, the sedimentary cover progressively thins suggesting that the western edge of the Kaapvaal is an extended margin. Interpreted deep crustal shear zones indicate a major terrane boundary separating the Proterozoic from the Archean. Depths to basement inferred from aeromagnetic data are consistent with the depth to the Seismic boundary associated with the top of the Archean. Some of the aeromagnetic expression may be due to Karoo volcanic intrusives in the basement. A thrust belt in the northwest of the area now buried in the mid crust is correlated with the nearby Ghanzi-Chobe belt and allows the mid-crustal layering to be dated as late Proterozoic. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

The crustal thickness beneath the graben decreases northwards from 35 km beneath the culmination of the Kenya dome to 20 km under Lake Turkana. Anomalous low mantle velocities of 7.5-7.6 km/s suggest that the upper mantle immediately beneath the Rift may contain reservoirs of magmas, which were generated at greater depth. A comparison of the shape and size of the observed Bouguer anomaly with the LVZ suggests that the upper mantle beneath the Rift probably includes some 5% partial melt, concentrated in the areas with lowest velocities. These results provide new constraints for geodynamic models of the evolution of the Kenya Rift. -from Authors},

Numerous Phanerozoic rifts spanning a wide range of inferred palaeoclimates have consistent relationships between structure and sedimentation, and between structural evolution and stratigraphic sequences. Six principal structural features which strongly influence sedimentation patterns in rifts are described. These structural controls occur in the present-day low latitude rifts of East Africa, where climate ranges from arid to humid. Similar features have been identified in ancient rifts that are interpreted to span a comparable range in climates. Clearly, climate is important in determining the sedimentary history of continental rifts. The present study indicates that climatic effects, however, are superimposed on the fundamental structural geometries that evolve during rifting. -from Authors},

Marginal upwarps not only significantly influence the geomorphological evolution of rifted margins and their adjacent continental interiors, but are also important in determining patterns of offshore sedimentation. Here we show that the contrast in denudation rates between the evolving coastal flanks of rifted margins and their interior hinterlands can promote significant marginal upwarps if the lithosphere responds flexurally to the resulting differential unloading2,3. Using data for the western margin of southern Africa, we demonstrate that upwarps of 600 m with respect to the adjacent continental interior can be generated by this process independently of the mechanics of rifting. {\textcopyright} 1990 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {Foreland and rift margin basins are compared on the basis of (1) their tectonic setting, (2) reasons for subsidence, and (3) their large-scale geophysical and geological characteristics. The thermal and mechanical properties of the underlying lithosphere are shown to be fundamental to the form of tectonic subsidence. The lithosphere beneath foreland basins is flexurally downwarped by the loading of the adjacent fold--thrust belt, whereas tectonic subsidence at rifted margins is caused by mass replacement at depth, during lithospheric extension on rifting, and subsequent thermal contraction as the lithosphere cools. The effects of rheology, thermal maturity, and lateral changes in properties of the lithosphere are outlined for foreland basins, as is the topographic effect of possible phase changes beneath the fold--thrust belt. The thermal and rheological consequences of lithospheric extension at rift margins makes flexural subsidence relatively less important than in foreland basins. Flexure may, however, be partly responsible for uplift landward of the hinge line that is associated with rifting. Other mechanisms that could cause such uplift include depth-dependent extension and thermal expansion due to the lateral diffusion of heat. The models describing the evolution of these basins are shown to predict characteristics that are in accord with observations. The superposition of foreland and rift margin basins as a result of ocean closure can lead to an overall basin stratigraphy that is complex. Such phases of basin subsidence must be separated according to the tectonic environment in which they formed in any analysis of the cause and consequences of basin evolution.},

abstract = {We formulate a mechanical model describing the formation of rifts as finite amplitude necking of an elastic-plastic layer overlying a fluid substrate. A perfectly plastic rheology is a continuum description of faulting in rift zones. Two important aspects of rift evolution are illustrated by this model: the evolution of the rift width as extension proceeds and the finite strain that occurs. A region at yield initially develops with a width determined by the thickness of the brittle layer, and the internal deformation within this yield zone is proportional to the topographic slope. As extension proceeds, the surface within the rift subsides, and the width of the subsiding yield zone decreases. At any stage of rifting, matedhal in regions just outside the yield zone is deformed but no longer deforming. The width of these deformed regions increases with increasing extension. Vertical forces due to the mass deficit of the rift depression will flex the elastic layer outside the yield zone, creating flanking uplifts. The external force required to maintain active rifting increases with the amount of lithospheric stretching, indicating that rifting is a quasi-static, stable process. Because the yield zone will revert to elastic behavior if the external force causing extension is removed, the model predicts that the rift depression and flanking uplifts will be preserved after extension stops. Our simple mechanical model demonstrates the inherent relationship among graben formation, lithospheric thinning, and rift shoulder uplift in rift zones.},

After first summarizing what has been learned about the registration and development of charged particle trac k s from p revious accelerator and r eactor experiments, we describ e the observa tions on natural background tr acks. Tracks can o ccur randomly throughout a sample and in clusters which are usually, but not always, associated with an identifiable structural feature such as an inclusion . Track densities vary from an unobservably low value to >5 X 104/cm'. The tracks ap pear most frequently in biotites and phlogopites , less often in muscovites , and still less often in lepidolites . Various possible origins of the background tracks are discussed, and it is concluded that sp ontaneous fission of uranium impurities is the most likely source. If the tracks arise in this way, track counts before and aft er reactor irradiation give, in principle, a measure of the age of the mica specimens. Ages determined in thi s way for two specimens were in approximate agreement with geologic ages, thus giving strong experimental confirmation of the spontaneous fission origin of the tracks. The results also indicate that the time constant for track fading must be >10" years. The possible use of this new technique as an accurate method of dating mica samples is discussed. Track densities also give a measure of uranium concentrations, and we find values ranging from approximately 10 .. 8 to 10 .. 11 atom fraction, exclusive of uranium in inclusions and grain boundaries, which shows that the solubility of uranium in mica is very small. Calculations also indicate that cosmic-ray-induced tracks should be found in certain specimens which have very low uranium concentrations and which have been at a depth less than that equivalent to 1 km of water for long periods of time . It is likely that fossil tracks will be found in materials other than mica. The picture developed here for mica applies e qually well to such other systems .},

abstract = {Major detachment faults play a key role in the lithospheric extension process in the Basin and Range province and may also be important in other continental extension terranes. Such detachment faulting leads to an inherent asymmetry of extensional structure and of uplift/subsidence patterns. Detachment models developed for the formation of metamorphic core complexes can also be applied to the formation of passive continental margins. We therefore suggest the existence of upper-plate and lower-plate passive margins. These give rise to a complementary asymmetry of opposing margins after continental breakup. Transfer faults offset marginal features and allow margins to switch from upper-plate to lower-plate characteristics along strike.},

abstract = {The plateau edge of southern Oman is used as a natural laboratory to independently test apatite fission-track analysis, (U-Th)/He dating, and stratigraphy as methods for quantifying post-rift erosion depths and lithospheric response at passive margins. A mappable unconformity between the Proterozoic basement and the low-conductivity, pre-rift sediment cover links residual buttes preserved at the coast to the escarpment, and therefore imposes tight limitations on parameter choices for modeling the Cenozoic topographic evolution. A mean geothermal gradient of ∼33 °C km-1 ensures the best fit between the thermochronologic data and the stratigraphically defined coast-to-scarp maximum denudation depth of ∼1.75 km. With a lithospheric elastic thickness of 7 km, the resulting flexural response generates a retreat and uplift of the escarpment associated with a seaward downwarp of the unconformity, made possible because denudation minima are inboard of the escarpment and sediment loading occurs offshore. This closed experiment confirms the value of low-temperature thermochronology as a tool for quantifying long-term erosion, but also highlights the benefits of including independent stratigraphic information in terms of obtaining more plausible solutions. This study suggests that post-rift downwarping of eroded rift shoulders can occur, and may have not been commonly detected because low-temperature thermochronology data sets lack both suitable geologic data and intrinsic sensitivity. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Geological Society of America.},

@article{Richardson1988,
abstract = {Subsidence analysis (backstripping) was carried out on a series of wells from the Gulf of Suez and northern Red Sea region of Egypt in order to examine the interplay between tectonic events, basin subsidence, sedimentation and sea level changes in a young, developing ocean basin and continental margin. Using constraints on chronostratigraphy and paleodepth from various sources combined with stratigraphic and structural information from industry wells and other geophysical sources it has been possible to compile the data necessary to perform geohistory analyses throughout the region. Major subsidence due to crustal thinning began ∼25 Ma with sedimentation initially occurring in isolated sub-basins. These earliest sediments record the transition from continental to marine depositional environments. Subsequently during early and middle Miocene times subsidence was rapid and uniform along and across the entire rift basin. Open marine sedimentation occurred across all structural regimes. The mid-Clysmic tectonic event (16.5 Ma) resulted in structural rearrangement of the rift basin and uplift of the rift shoulders. Rapid subsidence continued as global sea level fell, producing a series of prograding, siliciclastic fan-deltas at the rift margins. At ∼15.5 Ma, opening of the Suez rift was terminated, tectonic subsidence decreased dramatically in the southern rift and ceased entirely in the northern rift. Tensional plate motion probably was transferred from the Gulf of Suez to sinistral strike-slip movement on the Dead Sea transform at this time. The quiescence in subsidence combined with a lowered global sea level resulted in the deposition of a thick (up to 4 km) series of evaporites within the central trough of the rift from the middle to latest Miocene. The accumulation of such a thick sequence of sediments during a phase of decreased tectonic subsidence is interpreted as a 'filling-in' of the rift topography which developed during the earlier period of rapid subsidence and rift-shoulder uplift and continued compaction. A rapid global sea level rise concomitant with a subsequent pulse of increased tectonic activity in the latest Miocene-earliest Pliocene returned the rift to dominantly marine conditions. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

Although the intermediate- and long-range topographic variation of the 660-kilometer boundary between Earth's upper and lower mantle is well studied, small-scale measurements are far more challenging. We found a surprising amount of topography at short length scale along the 660-kilometer boundary in certain regions using scattered P'P' seismic waves. Our observations required chemical layering in regions with high short-scale roughness. By contrast, we did not see such small-scale topography along the 410-kilometer boundary in the upper mantle. Our ﬁndings support the concept of partially blocked or imperfect circulation between the upper and lower mantle.},

@article{Ketcham2018,
abstract = {The ability to derive detailed thermal history information from apatite fission-track analysis is predicated on the reliability of track length measurements. However, insufficient attention has been given to whether and how these measurements should be standardized. In conjunction with a fission-track workshop we conducted an experiment in which 11 volunteers measured $\sim$ 50 track lengths on one or two samples. One mount contained Durango apatite with unannealed induced tracks, and one contained apatite from a crystalline rock containing spontaneous tracks with a broad length distribution caused by partial resetting. Results for both mounts showed scatter indicative of differences in measurement technique among the individual analysts. The effects of this variability on thermal history inversion were tested using the HeFTy computer program to model the spontaneous track measurements. A cooling-only scenario and a reheating scenario more consistent with the sample's geological history were posed. When a uniform initial length value from the literature was used, results among analysts were very inconsistent in both scenarios, although normalizing for track angle by projecting all lengths to a c-axis parallel crystallographic orientation improved some aspects of congruency. When the induced track measurement was used as the basis for thermal history inversion congruency among analysts, and agreement with inversions based on data previously collected, was significantly improved. Further improvement was obtained by using c-axis projection. Differences among inversions that persisted could be traced to differential sampling of long- and short-track populations among analysts. The results of this study, while demonstrating the robustness of apatite fission-track thermal history inversion, nevertheless point to the necessity for a standardized length calibration schema that accounts for analyst variation. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Gunnell1998,
abstract = {The paper presents a denudational rift flank uplift model of the Western Ghats of Karnataka, India. The Cenozoic denudation of the Deccan plateau was constrained by relative dating of regional planation surface levels, in combination with preliminary apatite fission track results. The denudational history of the Western Ghats escarpment coastal foreland was constrained both by onshore fission track and offshore sediment data. Methods are briefly described. Results were used as reference data to elaborate a computer simulation model of both flexural rift flank upwarp and escarpment retreat from the K/T boundary to the present. Depending on the assumptions concerning the attributes of the thin elastic lithospheric sheet (infinite or semi-infinite), the shape and elevation of the initial Deccan topography (flat-lying, or affected by lithospheric updoming due to the Reunion mantle plume) and the position of the continental divide upon rifting, the flexural response to denudational unloading is shown to yield either a concave-up flexure of the Dharwar craton, or a convex, monoclinal downwarp of the margin. The relative merits of each model are discussed in the light of auxiliary field evidence, particularly from the neighbouring Deccan traps. However, the diverse assumptions on boundary conditions fail to entirely avoid geomorphological equifinality.},

@article{Flament2013,
abstract = {The topography of Earth is primarily controlled by lateral differences in the density structure of the crust and lithosphere. In addition to this isostatic topography, flow in the mantle induces deformation of its surface leading to dynamic topography. This transient deformation evolves over tens of millions of years, occurs at long wavelength, and is relatively small (<2 km) in amplitude. Here, we review the observational constraints and modeling approaches used to understand the amplitude, spatial pattern, and time dependence of dynamic topography. The best constraint on the present-day dynamic topography induced by sublithospheric mantle flow is likely the residual bathymetry calculated by removing the isostatic effect of oceanic lithospheric structure from observed bathymetry. Increasing knowledge of the thermal and chemical structure of the lithosphere is important to better constrain present-day mantle flow and dynamic topography. Nevertheless, at long wavelengths (>5000 km), we show that there is good agreement between published residual topography fields, including the one described here, and present-day dynamic topography predicted from mantle flow models, including a new one. Residual and predicted fields show peak-to-peak amplitudes of roughly ±2 km and a dominant degree two pattern with high values for the Pacific Ocean, southern Africa, and the North Atlantic and low values for South America, western North America, and Eurasia. The flooding of continental interiors has long been known to require both larger amplitudes and to be temporally phase-shifted compared with inferred eustatic changes. Such long-wavelength inferred vertical motions have been attributed to dynamic topography. An important consequence of dynamic topography is that long-term global sea-level change cannot be estimated at a single passive margin. As a case study, we compare the results of three published models and of our model to the subsidence history of well COST-B2 offshore New Jersey. The <400 ± 45 m amount of anomalous subsidence of this well since 85 Ma is best explained by models that predict dynamic subsidence of the New Jersey margin during that period. Explicitly including the lithosphere in future global mantle flow models should not only facilitate such comparisons between model results and data, but also further constrain the nature of the coupling between the mantle and the lithosphere. {\textcopyright} 2013 Geological Society of America.},
